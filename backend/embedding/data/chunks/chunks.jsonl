The licensing\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parentheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for\nshipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China andCountry Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand\nthat partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified,\nimpose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, orcorresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs,(including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include\nfuture NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performanceand/or performance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meetthe characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long\nterm, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG haschanged and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensingrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and\nmay be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well asother impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose\nrestrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG isconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact ourability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing exportcontro"}

If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adverselyaffected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers willdemand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We\ncannot ensure that our products and technologies will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financialresults may be harmed.\nWe offer enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and services for training and deploying AImodels. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloudservice agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services have changed\nand may continue to shift, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX Cloud services may not be successful and will take time,resources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and\nother software products. These new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software orservices. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings.\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customerand market needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-expected selling prices or demand for our products.

Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, largercustomer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, more design\n15\nTable of Contents\nwins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent usfrom doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge\non our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some ofour customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those\nwe are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establishmarket share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demandfor our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately,\nhas led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impactingthe semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums,provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue.We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supplycommitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both\nproduct shortages and excess inventory, significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners andcontract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to meet increased customer demand in a timelymanner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our\nproducts are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have abroader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are\nnot available from third parties.\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventoryor reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for\ncertain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and mayhave to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical\nlead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue toincrease as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All ofthese factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,include:\n• changes in product development cycles and time to market;\n• competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\n• changes in business and economic conditions;\n• sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\n• rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n• the availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;\n• new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n• new or unexpected end-use cases;\n• increase in demand for competitive products;\n"}

Extended lead times may occur ifwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical toour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply bothcurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying componentcompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if ourinventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and supportnew products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\nproducts. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set ofAI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutionseach year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. Qualificationtime for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new productintroductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation\narchitectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and futurearchitecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as\nplanned for any reason. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues thatcould increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarterof fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\nWe incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other productsor adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be\nable to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.

While we have managed prior producttransitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact oursupply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be ableto generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any\nreasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.\nThe use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand for our products, including by leading toinconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum.\nIt is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of\n17\nTable of Contents\ncryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in\ncryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchaintransactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced andmay in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs,which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may\nbe resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces competewith our new products and distribution channels. Our inability to accurately predict our demand that arises from new use cases may create volatility in our\nrevenue.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over productquantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test, or package ourproducts, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These subcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and\nproducts. We face risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negativelyimpact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results,including:\n• lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity;\n• decommitment by our suppliers;\n• potential higher wafer and component prices resulting from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient\nquantities or timely;\n• failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our\nproducts;\n• failure by our foundries to develop, obtain, or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometryprocess technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;\n• failure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;\n• limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers and memory\nmanufacturers;\n• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volumeproduction or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;\n• lack of direct control over product quantity, quality, and delivery schedules;\n• integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers creating more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning,\nexecution, and logistics;\n• suppliers or their suppliers failing to provide high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;\n• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or highe"}

They have in the past and may in the future contain defects, security vulnerabilities,\nexperience failures, or unsatisfactory performance due to issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks mayalso increase when our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, or new versions are released, and when we rely onpartners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. AI software\nproducts that we or our partners offer rely on training data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may containunknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for productdefect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in\nour products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties\nwho develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specificationscould lead to substantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIB manufacturers, automotive manufacturers,and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair or\nreplacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and managementpersonnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our\ncustomers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure toachieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing andprospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin,\nrevenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in thefield or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and otherdefects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods.We recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty\nobligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any ofour products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of\ndefending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business.

These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and\ninterest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of ourinvestment portfolio comprises USG securities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit rating due to an actual or\nthreatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverseconditions. These factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges.\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured,assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 53% of our revenue in fiscal year 2025 from sales\noutside the United States. The market in China, where our offerings are limited by export controls, is highly competitive and we expect it to remain competitivegoing forward. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restore from backups is delayedor not feasible.\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged\nand are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally, some actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinatedattacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be subject to a heightened risk of\ncyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentionalmisconduct by employees, contractors or other third-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees,contractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control\nmechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive informationor adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms, including, for example, employees posting company data on third-party websites withoutpermission, and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat or error will not\nresult in an incident that is material to us or lead to negative publicity. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operatecertain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other\nfunctions, which exposes us to\n20\nTable of Contents\nsupply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains\nhave not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our informationtechnology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. We have incorporated\nthird-party data into some of our AI models and used open-source datasets to train our models and may continue to do so. These datasets may be flawed,insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise decrease resilience to security incidents that may compromise the integrity of our AIoutputs, leading to potential reputational damage, regulatory scrutiny, or adverse impacts on the performance and reliability of our products, which could, in turn,\naffect our partners' operations, customer trust, and our revenue. We may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers,including for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate informationsecurity measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the past and may happen in the\nfuture), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the securityincident.

Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are\ncompromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business.\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected toresult in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed\nto ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicableindustry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate\ncertain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls,systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after asecurity incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security measures,\nalong with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties,could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatoryinquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code\nfrom third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to the risk ofloss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on\nexperience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverseconsequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation,indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our\nsystems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders,delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. We arerequired by certain data privacy and security obligations to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of\nsecurity incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity. In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties maygather, collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to harm our business.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause disruptions to our worldwide operations include: natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, power\nor water shortages, critical infrastructure failures, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest,acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory changes, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events.

Geopolitical and domesticpolitical developments and other events beyond our control can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse\npolitical developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our productcomponents and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our\noperations and operating strategies, product\n21\nTable of Contents\ndemand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with\nthe State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economicboycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including\nnatural disasters, high heat events, water shortages, power shortages, information technology system failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, andbusiness, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located andconsolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war, or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or\nour customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fullyresume operations. Our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. All of these risks and conditions could\nmaterially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 4,700employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Some of our\nemployees in the region have been on active military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our productdevelopment or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended or expanded, it\ncould impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including due to the eventsdescribed above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As\nwe increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortagesand other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages,land or permitting constraints, or regulations that limit energy, water, or land availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center\ncapacity and consume our products and services, which may in turn negatively impact our business.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors.

Although wemaintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability andcost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not\ncovered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. New or proposed regulations\nrelating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result ingreater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes,increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, and\ngreater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictionscould harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We\nmay not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals.We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased\nlitigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be negatively impacted by concernsaround the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing\nplatforms.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate\nacquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives.\nAcquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our productsand ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactionsthat could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining\nregulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology mayevolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively\nimpact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceivedability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in publicly tradedcompanies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to\ninvest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stagecompanies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment,\nand we are not always able to achieve a return.

Further, our investments in publicly tradedcompanies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to\ninvest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stagecompanies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment,\nand we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairmentand/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industrysectors could increase our impairment losses.\nWe face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’sattention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in\nobtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisitionor investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or areacquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n• difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key\npersonnel, of the acquired business;\n• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n• integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n• coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n• stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close anacquisition;\n• potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants orother restrictions;\n• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n• exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy andcostly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processeswith our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of\noperations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to\ncustomers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any ofthese customers.\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue. Sales to\ndirect Customers A, B and C represented 12%, 11% and 11% of total revenue, respectively, for fiscal year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to theCompute & Networking segment. With\n23\nTable of Contents\nseveral of these partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales to ourpartner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our technologies. We have a small number of partners that are involved\nin system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications ofour key customers. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm ourability to sell our advanced data center systems to customers. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our\nproducts into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, ourcustomers can generally cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may\ndevelop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in themarkets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of our indirect customers often do notpurchase directly from us but through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect\ncustomer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% ormore of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.

For fiscal year 2025, an indirect\ncustomer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% ormore of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near\na quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing andamount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. orother countries’ trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo remain competitive and successfully execute our business strategy, we must attract, retain, and motivate our executives and key employees, as well asrecruit and develop exceptional and diverse talent. However, labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly\ncompetitive market for skilled workers and leaders, and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations, or in theiradministration or interpretation, could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for talent drives up costs in the form of cash and\nstock-based compensation. In times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of ourstock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effectivesuccession planning, transfer of knowledge, and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning, execution, and\nlong-term success.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such\nsystems may disrupt our business and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financialreporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our\ngrowth. We continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP systemimplementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully\noperate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could imposesubstantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm ouroperating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financialstatements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate anymaterial weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results\non a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may besubject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securitiesanalysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on our past\nresults of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\n• our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\n• our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\n24\nTable of Contents\n• our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain\ncredit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs;\n• our vendors' payment requirements;\n• unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\n• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretati"}

For example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended\npayment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors haverequested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we haveavailable for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth, creating\nvolatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts islikely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or substantial price volatility.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export of our products, which mayadversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls\nand cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; productregulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws.Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations\nand ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violateapplicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines,\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws,rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs,and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance\ncosts as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurityvulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the EuropeanUnion, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding\nour business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We havealso received, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United\nKingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and ourinvestments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, ourstrategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and\npartners. We expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests may be expensive and burdensome and could negatively impactour business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.\nGovernments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to developfrontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-yeartransitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already\nenacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.Restrictions unde"}

Several states are considering enacting or have already\nenacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of\nnew systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions tolaws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import dutiesor tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the\ntiming of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negativelyimpact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import orexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on\n25\nTable of Contents\nthe activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products,provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List orother USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse\neffect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if theviolation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse\nimpact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures whichblocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to\nRussia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of\nenabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,\ntuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and usersworldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.\nAs geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export controlrestrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associated\nproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope andapplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China and over 150 countriesdesignated “Tier 2” by the January 2025 AI Diffusion IFR, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or\ncould impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financialresults.

Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associatedwith AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our\nproducts, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AIcloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside Chinaand for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for ourproducts, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to\nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impactingour business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.\nAdditional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research anddevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve\noverseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide ourproducts and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about oursales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. For example, regulators\nin China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. If regulatorsconclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties, restrictions\non our ability to conduct our business, restrictions regarding our networking products and services, or otherwise impact our operations in China, any of whichcould have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOver the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, impacting our ability to serve customers outsidethe United States.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and\nsupercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,\nDGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integratedcircuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There arealso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in\nChina. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 productsdestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports toChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of ourproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090.

The licensing\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parentheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40Sproducts (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject tothese requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. To\ndate, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified,\nimpose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, orcorresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs,(including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include\nfuture NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performanceand/or performance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet\nthe characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier 2” status. The AI Diffusion IFR would confer special benefits on\nselect “Universal Verified End Users”, or UVEU, and lesser benefits on “National Verified End Users”, or NVEU. The AI Diffusion IFR would have numerouseffects that may negatively impact our long-term financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by expressly limiting exports, reexports,\nand transfers of covered products to Tier 2 countries and companies in Tier 1 countries that are either headquartered in Tier 2, or have an ultimate parentheadquartered in a Tier 2 country. These restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a select number of government-approved firmsthat achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own accelerators, platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG regulations, including foreign competition.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers’ costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges and risks, and impact our supply anddistribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and related extraterritorial regulatory obligations.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from other countries, in the form of tariffs, import/exportcontrols, or other regulatory actions.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR’s licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers using\ncovered products, or supply customers with covered products outside the impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one ormore of the identified countries.\n27\nTable of Contents\nFollowing these 2022 export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of Chinaand Hong Kong.

Even if a license is approved, it may impose burdensome conditions thatwe or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG evaluates license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or\nan opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customersin China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and\nmay in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquirelicenses for their products.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the longterm, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, ifcustomers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other\nextended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transitioncosts. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end userscannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale\ntechnical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductorsuppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any timeand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In theevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countriesdesignated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a\nservice large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may imposeadditional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorizedsystem configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands\nsuch controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of suchproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may\nhave a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for asubstantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs mayalso negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking\nproducts, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new controlthat impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitorsthat sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside\nChina and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure thatthey are able to serve markets worldwide.

Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas\ngovernments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, andfinancial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also inother markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced\nsemiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At thesame time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. If additional products are\nsubject to worldwide licensing requirements, we may incur significant inventory provisions and excess purchase obligation charges.\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured inwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming\nrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encouragecustomers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing\ncomponents made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containingcertain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses newstandards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the\nChinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard,this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results\nand financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any newrestrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our\nbusiness and financial results.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks\nand adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nCertain shareholder advocacy groups, investment funds, shareholders and other market participants, customers and government regulators have focused oncorporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our\ncorporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there are state-level initiatives in the U.S. that may differ from other regulatoryrequirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. Additionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may\nnot meet evolving shareholder, regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reportingstandards or legal requirements.

These factors and increased disclosure may negatively harm our brand, reputation and businessactivities or expose us to liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harmand liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and\nservices, and we also offer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect itsadoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutionsthat have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or\nother social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development anduse of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Leveraging\nAI capabilities to potentially improve our internal functions and operations may present further risks, costs, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulationsfrom different jurisdictions related to AI may further increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, and mayimpede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and\nproposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development,and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European Union Code of Practice for\nGeneral Purpose Artificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission regarding details of some of our Trustworthy AI processes related toour risk framework. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our businesspractices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of AI by\nus or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful\nor if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or partiesthat we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties,\npayment of lost profits, or injunctive relief.

The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm\nour competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development andmarketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seekformal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if\napproved, whether they will be enforceable.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. These areas could damage our\nreputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external andinternal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate\nuse of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters,including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in\nour possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increasedsecurity or remediation costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal\ndata privacy and consumer protection. Numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses,including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights\nmay include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising,profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain statesalso impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments.\nThese state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California PrivacyRights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personalinformation, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for substantial fines for intentional violation and the law\ncreated a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels.Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of AI and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to\nadditional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adoptedthe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of\npersons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whosedata is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or\n4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing oftheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act and similar legislation could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage usand require us to change our business practices. Additionally, Europe’s Network and Information Security Directive, or NIS2, regulates resilience and incident\nresponse capabilities of entities operating in a number of sectors, including the digital "}

Furthermore, the EU AI Act and similar legislation could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage usand require us to change our business practices. Additionally, Europe’s Network and Information Security Directive, or NIS2, regulates resilience and incident\nresponse capabilities of entities operating in a number of sectors, including the digital infrastructure sector. Non-compliance with NIS2 may lead to administrativefines of a maximum of 10 million Euros or up to 2% of the total worldwide revenue of the preceding fiscal year.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certainjurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data\n30\nTable of Contents\ntransfer laws. For example, the GDPR governs the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of“Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not foundto provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify complianceand participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these\nmechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to theUnited States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, anyof which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes various\nrequirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China’s law, including personal data, may not betransferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements,\nincluding CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China orimpact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact ourbusiness operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to\nincrease our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companiesfrom transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness.\nWe are also bound by certain contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successfulor may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific\ncontractual restrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered thatpersonal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materialsand other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. Regulators in the U.S. are\nincreasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair ormisrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that isinconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems andpractices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with\nsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significantconsequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing\npersonal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data.

Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financialcondition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected\ntax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Althoughwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxesimposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause otheradverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the U.S., with\na significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced,our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income, and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, our tax obligations and effective taxrate in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase as a result of international tax developments, including the implementation of the Two-Pillar\nframework led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certainmultinational enterprises above a fixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to as Pillar One), and imposes a minimumeffective corporate tax rate (referred to as Pillar Two). A number of countries in which we conduct business have enacted, or are in the process of enacting,\nelements of the Pillar Two rules. Any such tax laws, or changes in any such tax laws may increase tax uncertainty and compliance costs and adversely affect ourprovision for income taxes, cash tax payments, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countrieswith differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions,\n31\nTable of Contents\nthe expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses notdeductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of\nexisting laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our businessand structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective taxrate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our\neffective tax rate, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the burden and risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder,\nconsumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholdersasserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency\nmining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetarydamages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring otherremedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact.

Provisions in our certificate ofincorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of ourBoard of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder\napproval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if\nsomeone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock.These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directorsof their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nWe have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and reactively address circumstances that arise when\nunexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These include processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecuritythreats. Our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard for\nInformation Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and riskmanagement and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes, and we have in place\ncybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy and cybersecurity laws and (b) prevent,detect, respond to, mitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threats.\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the supplier and data they process on our behalf, thedistribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties thathave access to confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designed to ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and\nsecurity controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the supplier and data theyprocess on our behalf. We routinely assess our high-risk suppliers’ conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT), and we\nevaluate them for additional information, product, and physical security requirements.\nRefer to “Item 1A.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” ourConsolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report onForm 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock. \nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of thegaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin\napplications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Demand for ourHopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2025.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to\ngenerate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity andscale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply bothcurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more\ncomplexity "}

Demand for ourHopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2025.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.

With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply bothcurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying componentcompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if ourinventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct Transitions and New Product Introductions\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and supportnew products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\nproducts. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set ofAI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\neach year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and productconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increasedfrequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impactour ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\nfrequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair ourability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\nGlobal Trade\nIn August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia\nof our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\n36\nTable of Contents\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports toChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensingrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately forshipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and\nCountry Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understandthat partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice beforeeach shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew infiscal year 2025. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels seen prior to the onset of export controls in October 2023. The\nmarket in China for datacenter solutions remains competitive. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers.

The\nmarket in China for datacenter solutions remains competitive. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. To the extent that acustomer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant sucha license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified,impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs,(including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will includefuture NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance\nand/or performance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet\nthe characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the longterm, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has\nchanged and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensingrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and\nmay be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well asother impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may imposerestrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact ourability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing exportcontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors– Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, tariffs, and global economic andgeopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and\nquantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of ourinvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously\nmanage product availability and costs with our vendors.\n37\nTable of Contents\nIsrael and Regional Conflicts\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 4,700employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our global\nsupply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Some of our employees in the region have been on active military duty foran extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations.

The\npreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost ofrevenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimationuncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories,\nincome taxes, and revenue recognition. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.\nInventories\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, andfor excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels\nand future product purchase\n38\nTable of Contents\ncommitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions,changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, including potential cancellation or deferral of customer purchase\norders, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existingproducts or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulationsand the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.3% in fiscal year 2025and 2.7% in fiscal year 2024. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party\nmanufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months forsome products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums andprovide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors,\nnew product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRef"}

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates andjudgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,\nin part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where weoperate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded taxliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statementsaccordingly.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized based on all available evidence.To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during theperiod.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical meritsof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Allowances\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking\ndistributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allowreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs\nbased on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs forspecific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program\naccruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting\nperiod, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\n39\nTable of Contents\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer\ncontract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require asignificant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinctand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standaloneselling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in\ncomparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or serviceseparately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\nResult"}

A discussion\nregarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report onForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website athttp://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. \n  Year Ended\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024\nRevenue 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of revenue 25.0 27.3 \nGross profit 75.0 72.7 \nOperating expenses  \nResearch and development 9.9 14.2 \nSales, general and administrative 2.7 4.4 \nTotal operating expenses 12.6 18.6 \nOperating income 62.4 54.1 \nInterest income 1.4 1.4 \nInterest expense (0.2) (0.4)\nOther, net 0.8 0.4 \nOther income (expense), net 2.0 1.4 \nIncome before income tax 64.4 55.5 \nIncome tax expense 8.6 6.6 \nNet income 55.8 % 48.9 %\n40\nTable of Contents\nReportable Segments\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 $Change %Change\n($ in millions)\nCompute & Networking $ 116,193 $ 47,405 $ 68,788 145 %\nGraphics 14,304 13,517 787 6 %\nTotal $ 130,497 $ 60,922 $ 69,575 114 %\nOperating Income by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 $Change %Change\n($ in millions)\nCompute & Networking $ 82,875 $ 32,016 $ 50,859 159 %\nGraphics 5,085 5,846 (761) (13)%\nAll Other (6,507) (4,890) (1,617) 33 %\nTotal $ 81,453 $ 32,972 $ 48,481 147 %\nCompute & Networking revenue – The year over year increase was due to strong demand for our accelerated computing and AI solutions. Revenue from DataCenter computing grew 162% driven primarily by demand for our Hopper computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and\ngenerative AI applications. Revenue from Data Center networking grew 51% driven by Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernetplatform.\nGraphics revenue – The year over year increase was driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\nReportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income was driven by growth in revenue. Theyear over year decrease in Graphics segment operating income was driven by an increase of 44% in segment operating expenses, partially offset by growth in\nrevenue.\nAll Other operating loss – The year over year increase was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth andcompensation increases.\nConcentration of Revenue\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as AIBs, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We\nhave certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to completetheir build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, consumer internetcompanies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\nDirect Customers – Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Compute &Networking segment, are presented in the following table:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024\nDirect Customer A 12 % *\nDirect Customer B 11 % 13 %\nDirect Customer C 11 % *\n* Less than 10% of total revenue.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2023.\n41\nTable of Contents\nIndirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, productspecifications, internal sales data, and other sources.

Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test\nyield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-relatedintangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related topersonnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margins increased to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025 from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024. The year over year increase was primarily driven by a higher mix of DataCenter revenue.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Sales ofpreviously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $689 million and $540 million for fiscalyears 2025 and 2024, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.3% and 2.7% in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\n Year Ended\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 $Change %Change\n ($ in millions)\nResearch and development expenses $ 12,914 $ 8,675 $ 4,239 49 %\n% of net revenue 9.9 % 14.2 %   \nSales, general and administrative expenses 3,491 2,654 837 32 %\n% of net revenue 2.7 % 4.4 %   \nTotal operating expenses $ 16,405 $ 11,329 $ 5,076 45 %\n% of net revenue 12.6 % 18.6 %\nThe increases in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2025 were driven by a 32% increase in compensation and benefits, including stock-basedcompensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases, a 100% increase in compute and infrastructure, and a 234% increase in engineering\ndevelopment costs for new product introductions.\nThe increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2025 were primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-basedcompensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n Year Ended\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 $Change\n ($ in millions)\nInterest income $ 1,786 $ 866 $ 920 \nInterest expense (247) (257) 10 \nOther, net 1,034 237 797 \nOther income (expense), net $ 2,573 $ 846 $ 1,727 \nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nInterest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.\nOther, net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-marketable equity securities, publicly-held equity securities, and theimpact of changes in foreign currency rates.

As of January 26, 2025, we had\n$43.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least thenext twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity\nand capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporationsand financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable\nsecurities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

We expect to increase capitalexpenditures in fiscal year 2026 relative to fiscal year 2025 to support the future growth of our business.\nUnrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $251 million, were recorded in non-current income tax payable at theend of fiscal year 2025. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties\nin the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nClimate Change\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcingrenewable energy or climate-related business trends.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of newand recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with ouroverall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and growth of our businesses.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve ofplus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for these investments of $238 million.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had $8.5 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on ourConsolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer toNote 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as substantially all of our sales are in United States dollars and foreign\ncurrency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are includedin other income or expenses. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2025and 2024.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange ratefluctuations.

Controls and Procedures\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of January 26, 2025, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that ourdisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information\nwe are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periodsspecified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer\nand our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act\nRule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, weconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025 based on the criteria set forth in Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under thecriteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as ofJanuary 26, 2025.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independentregistered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 26, 2025 that have materially affected, or arereasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our ERP system, which will update\nmuch of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. Theupgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal\ncontrols, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurancethat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\n46\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025,based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January\n26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2025 inconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over FinancialReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rulesand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used andsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, andtesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

Our audits also included performing such otherprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated orrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on thecritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventoryfor excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of\nproducts, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and marketconditions. As of January 26, 2025, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $10.1 billion and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory\npurchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $30.8 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess orobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing\nprovisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand andmarket conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions\nrelated to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess\nproduct purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures alsoincluded, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; andevaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equitybalances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were all 52-week years.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances andtransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reportedamounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, includingthose related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other\ncharges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe arereasonable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. Wedetermine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in\nthe contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue isallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance\nobligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Payment from customers, per our standard payment terms, isgenerally due shortly after delivery of products, availability of software licenses or commencement of services.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive inexchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support\nand extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances forreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and MDFs whichrepresent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while alsopromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs based\non the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize therevenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services\nare performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete eachproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase eitherperpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are\nfrequently sold along with support, which includes the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades.Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratablyover the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are providedon a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the\ncontract period. Revenue"}

Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the\ncontract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, butcertain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performanceobligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements\nindicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone\nselling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similarcircumstances and to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\nProduct Warranties\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardwarecomponent failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if aloss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporate financial performance targets. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of\ngrant to estimate the fair value of PSUs that are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs. The compensationexpense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensationexpense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model based on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of\nshares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March andSeptember of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, andmarket-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical forfeitures.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and\nother intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by thirdparties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that\ncauses us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,\n58\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\ninvestigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss. However, the actualliability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. If we determine thata loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollarsat end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheetamounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.

If we determine thata loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollarsat end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheetamounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated\nStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax\njurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporarydifferences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available\nevidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application ofcomplex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,\nchanges in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, werecognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be\ndue. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required torecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of January 26, 2025, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extentrealization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share iscomputed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Anyanti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be\ncash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased and publicly-heldequity securities. We classify these investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are\nreported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are\ndetermined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the Other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are subject to impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized costbasis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than\nnot we will be required or we intend to\n59\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\nsell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis.

Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the Other income (expense), net\nsection of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nPublicly-held equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in Other income (expense), net.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively shortmaturities as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024. Marketable debt and equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices.\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivativedepends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods\nof change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated asaccounting hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss andis subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges,\nchanges in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accountsreceivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, andincludes certain limits on our portfolio maturities. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for\npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overallestimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consistprimarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. Wecharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and forexcess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates anew cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in\nexcess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method\nbased on the estimated useful lives of the assets of two to seven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost andaccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leasesare amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating leaseassets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowingrate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over th"}

In completing\nour impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market\nvaluation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates andcomparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic\nfactors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under\ntechnology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using amethod that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliablydetermined, using a straight-line amortization method.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and\nused is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated bythe asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for theamount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separatelypresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no\nlonger be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recordedas goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently\nuncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing ofprojected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or finaldetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our ConsolidatedStatements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately-held companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value. These investments aremeasured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical orsimilar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative.

We adopted this standard in our fiscal year 2025 annual report. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of\ninformation in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We do not expect theadoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included withineach income statement expense caption, as applicable. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of\nthis standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would haveacquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate it due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. Werecorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\nNote 3 - Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is associated with RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and our ESPP.\nConsolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized into inventory and subsequently recognized to cost\nof revenue, as follows:\n Year Ended\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\n (In millions)\nCost of revenue $ 178 $ 141 $ 138 \nResearch and development 3,423 2,532 1,892 \nSales, general and administrative 1,136 876 680 \nTotal $ 4,737 $ 3,549 $ 2,710 \nStock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nThe following is a summary of equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\n(In millions, except per share data)\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs\nAwards granted 89 140 250 \nEstimated total grant-date fair value $ 7,834 $ 5,316 $ 4,505 \nWeighted average grant-date fair value per share $ 87.99 $ 37.41 $ 18.37 \nESPP\nShares purchased 30 30 30 \nWeighted average price per share $ 17.74 $ 15.81 $ 12.25 \nWeighted average grant-date fair value per share $ 8.61 $ 6.99 $ 5.19 \nAs of January 26, 2025, aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense was $11.6 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted averageperiod of 2.2 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and one year for ESPP.\nThe fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:\n Year Ended\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\n(Using the Black-Scholes model)\nESPP\nWeighted average expected life (in years) 0.1-2.0 0.1-2.0 0.1-2.0\nRisk-free interest rate 3.6%-5.4% 3.9%-5.5% —%-4.6%\nVolatility 31%-75% 31%-67% 43%-72%\nDividend yield 0.03% 0.06% 0.09%\nFor ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date.

The risk-free interest rateassumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock pricevolatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSUs, PSUs, and market-\nbased PSUs are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for thedividend yield.\nAdditionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical forfeitures.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions\nof various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performancestock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive\nstock options. We grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan. As of January 26, 2025, up to 274 million shares of our common stock couldbe issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, and 1.4 billion shares were available for future grants.\n63\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs vest generally over four years subject to continued service. PSUs vest over four years, subject to continued service andperformance conditions. Market-based PSUs vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to market conditions. However, the number of shares\nsubject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determinedcriteria.\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. Starting in March 2025,\nemployees may have up to 25% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Eachoffering period is about 24 months, divided into four purchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock\non each purchase date within the offering.

The amended\ncomplaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand\nbetween May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of theExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, includingattorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to\ndismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal fromjudgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panelaffirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in\ndismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision toreverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay\nthe mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s final disposition of the matter.NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024.

Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We areengaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe\nthat the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n74\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\nNote 13 - Income Taxes\nThe income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following:\n Year Ended\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\n (In millions)\nCurrent income taxes:    \nFederal $ 14,032 $ 5,710 $ 1,703 \nState 892 335 46 \nForeign 699 502 228 \nTotal current 15,623 6,547 1,977 \nDeferred income taxes:\nFederal (4,515) (2,499) (2,165)\nState (242) (206) — \nForeign 280 216 1 \nTotal deferred (4,477) (2,489) (2,164)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 11,146 $ 4,058 $ (187)\nIncome before income tax consists of the following:\n Year Ended\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\n (In millions)\nU.S. $ 77,456 $ 29,495 $ 3,477 \nForeign 6,570 4,323 704 \nIncome before income tax $ 84,026 $ 33,818 $ 4,181 \nThe income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income before income taxes as follows:\n Year Ended\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\n (In millions, except percentages)\nTax expense computed at federal statutory rate$ 17,645 21.0 % $ 7,102 21.0 % $ 878 21.0 %\nExpense (benefit) resulting from:\nState income taxes, net of federal tax effect 554 0.7 % 120 0.4 % 50 1.2 %\nForeign-derived intangible income (2,976) (3.5)% (1,408) (4.2)% (739) (17.7)%\nStock-based compensation (2,097) (2.5)% (741) (2.2)% (309) (7.4)%\nU.S. fede"}

This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is\nqualified in its entirety by express reference to, the applicable provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, which are filed as\nexhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, of which this Exhibit 4.6 is a part, and are incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to\nread our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) for more\ninformation.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 80,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock,\n$0.001 par value.\nCommon Stock\nThe holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. The\nholders of common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, and as a consequence, minority\nstockholders are not able to elect directors on the basis of their votes alone. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any shares of\npreferred stock currently outstanding or issued in the future, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be\ndeclared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then\noutstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other\nsecurities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Charter Documents\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nStockholders have no cumulative voting rights.\nOur certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly\ncalled annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing and that the stockholders may amend our\nbylaws or adopt new bylaws only by the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting securities in addition to any vote of the holders of\nany class or series of stock of the corporation required by law or by our certificate of incorporation.\nA special meeting of the stockholders may be called by:\n• our Chairman, if any;\n• our Chief Executive Officer;\n• a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; or\n• stockholders of record “owning” (as defined in the Bylaws) at least 15% of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting\nstock of the Company who have owned such shares continuously for at least one year, provided that the stockholders satisfy the\ndisclosure, timing and other requirements intended to ensure that stockholders receive adequate, timely and accurate information in\nconnection with a special meeting and avoid the unnecessary use of resources that would result from holding multiple stockholder\nmeetings in a short time period.\nThese provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.\nThe lack of cumulative voting could make it more difficult for our existing stockholders to replace our board of directors as well as for another\nparty to obtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our officers,\nthese provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management.\nThese and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management. These provisions\nare intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies of our board of\ndirectors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change in control.

These provisions are\ndesigned to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that\nmay be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares\nand, as a consequence, such provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could result from actual or rumored\ntakeover attempts. Such provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management.\nSection 203 of the DGCL\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business\ncombination” with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an “interested\nstockholder,” unless:\n• prior to such time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in\nthe stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder\nowned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of\ndetermining the voting stock outstanding those shares owned (a) by persons who are directors and also officers and (b) by employee\nstock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will\nbe tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n• at or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special\nmeeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is\nnot owned by the interested stockholder.\nIn general, Section 203 of the DGCL defines “business combination” to include the following:\n• any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder;\n• any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder;\n• subject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to\nthe interested stockholder;\n• any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of\nthe corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or\n• the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided\nby or through the corporation.\nIn general, Section 203 of the DGCL defines “interested stockholder” as an entity or person who beneficially owns (or within three years did own)\n15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with, controlling, controlled by or is under\ncommon control with such entity or person.\nCertain Transactions\nOur bylaws provide that we indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and any other applicable\nlaw. We are also empowered under our bylaws to indemnify other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other\napplicable law, to enter into indemnification contracts with our directors and executive officers and to purchase insurance on behalf of any person\nwhom we are required or permitted to indemnify.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that the liability of our directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated or limited to the\nfullest extent permissible under the DGCL. Pursuant to the DGCL, our directors shall not be liable for monetary damages for breach of the\ndirectors’ fiduciary duty of care to us and our stockholders. However, this provision does not eliminate the duty of care, and in appropriate\ncircumstances, equitable remedies such as injunctive or other forms of non-monetary relief that will remain available under the DGCL. In\naddition, each director will continue to be subject to liability for (1) breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, (2) acts or\nomissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) violating Section 174 of the DGCL, or (4)\nany transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. The provision also does not affect a director’s responsibilities\nunder any other law, such as the federal securities laws or state or federal environmental laws.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nComputershare is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.

General; Purpose.\n(a) The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “1998\nPlan”). From and after 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date, no additional rights to purchase shares of Common Stock will be\ngranted under the 1998 Plan. All rights to purchase shares granted on or after 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date will be\ngranted under this Plan. Any rights to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under the 1998 Plan will remain subject to the terms of the\n1998 Plan and any offering document or other agreements or governing documents describing the terms and conditions of offerings made\npursuant to the 1998 Plan.\n(i) Any shares of Common Stock that would otherwise remain available for future offerings under the 1998 Plan as of 12:01 a.m.\nPacific Standard Time on the Effective Date (the “1998 Plan's Available Reserve”) will cease to be available under the 1998 Plan at such time.\nInstead, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the 1998 Plan's Available Reserve will be added to the Share Reserve (as further\ndescribed in Section 3(a) below) and be then immediately available for grants hereunder, up to the maximum number set forth in Section 3(a)\nbelow.\n(ii) In addition, from and after 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date, with respect to the aggregate number of\nshares subject, at such time, to outstanding grants under the 1998 Plan that would, but for the operation of this sentence, subsequently return to\nthe share reserve of the 1998 Plan (such shares, the “Returning Shares”), such shares of Common Stock will not return to the share reserve of\nthe 1998 Plan, and instead that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Returning Shares will immediately be added to the Share\nReserve as and when such a share becomes a Returning Share, up to a maximum number set forth in Section 3(a) below.\n(b) The Plan provides a means by which Eligible Employees of the Company and certain Designated Companies may be given an\nopportunity to purchase shares of Common Stock. The Plan permits the Company to grant a series of Purchase Rights to Eligible Employees.\n(c) The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to retain the services of such Employees, to secure and retain the services of new\nEmployees and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and its Related Corporations.\n(d) This Plan includes two components: a 423 Component and a Non-423 Component. It is the intention of the Company to have the 423\nComponent qualify as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The provisions of the 423 Component, accordingly, will be construed in a manner that\nis consistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. In addition, this Plan authorizes the grant of Purchase Rights under the Non-423\nComponent that does not meet the requirements of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan because of deviations necessary or advisable to permit\nor\n9.\nfacilitate participation in the Plan by Employees who are foreign nationals or employed or located outside of the United States while complying\nwith applicable foreign laws; such Purchase Rights will be granted pursuant to rules, procedures or subplans adopted b"}

Except as otherwise provided herein or\ndetermined by the Board, the Non-423 Component will operate and be administered in the same manner as the 423 Component. In addition,\nunder the 423 Component of the Plan, the Company may make separate Offerings which vary in terms (although not inconsistent with the\nprovisions in the Plan and not inconsistent with the requirements of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan) and the Company will designate which\nDesignated Company is participating in each separate Offering.\n(e) If a Participant transfers employment from the Company or any Designated 423 Corporation participating in the 423 Component to a\nDesignated Non-423 Corporation participating in the Non-423 Component, he or she will immediately cease to participate in the 423 Component;\nhowever, any Contributions made for the Purchase Period in which such transfer occurs will be transferred to the Non-423 Component, and such\nParticipant will immediately join the then current Offering under the Non-423 Component upon the same terms and conditions in effect for his or\nher participation in the Plan, except for such modifications as may be required by applicable law. A Participant who transfers employment from a\nDesignated Non-423 Corporation participating in the Non-423 Component to the Company or any Designated 423 Corporation participating in\nthe 423 Component will remain a Participant in the Non-423 Component until the earlier of (i) the end of the current Offering Period under the\nNon-423 Component, or (ii) the Offering Date of the first Offering in which he or she participates following such transfer.\n2. Administration.\n(a) The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees, as\nprovided in Section 2(c).\n(b) The Board will have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:\n(i) To determine how and when Purchase Rights will be granted and the provisions of each Offering (which need not be identical),\nincluding which Designated 423 Corporations and Designated Non-423 Corporations will participate in the 423 Component or the Non-423\nComponent.\n(ii) To designate from time to time which Related Corporations of the Company will be eligible to participate in the Plan as\nDesignated 423 Corporations and Designated Non-423 Corporations and which Affiliates will be eligible to participate in the Plan as Designated\nNon-423 Corporations and also to designate which Designated Companies will participate in each separate Offering (to the extent the Company\nmakes separate Offerings).\n(iii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Purchase Rights, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its\nadministration.

Without limiting the generality of, but consistent with, the\nforegoing, the Board specifically is authorized to adopt rules, procedures and subplans, which, for purposes of the Non-423 Component, may be\noutside the scope of Section 423 of the Code, regarding, without limitation, eligibility to participate in the Plan, handling and making of\nContributions, establishment of bank or trust accounts to hold Contributions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency,\nobligations to pay payroll tax, determination of beneficiary designation requirements, withholding procedures and handling of share issuances,\nwhich may vary according to local requirements.\n(c) The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees.

In addition, the Board may (unless prohibited by law) provide that no Employee\nwill be eligible to be granted Purchase Rights under the Plan unless, on the Offering Date, such Employee's customary employment with the\nCompany, the Related Corporation or the Affiliate is more than 20 hours per week and more than five months per calendar year or such other\ncriteria as the Board may determine consistent with Section 423 of the Code.\n(b) The Board may provide that each person who, during the course of an Offering (or any specified period within an Offering), first\nbecomes an Eligible Employee will, on or after the day on which such person becomes an Eligible Employee, be granted a Purchase Right\nunder that Offering, which Purchase Right will thereafter be deemed to be a part of that Offering. Such Purchase Right will have the same\ncharacteristics as any Purchase Rights originally granted under that Offering, as described herein, except that:\n(i) the date on which such Purchase Right is granted will be the “Offering Date” of such Purchase Right for all purposes;\n(ii) the period of the Offering with respect to such Purchase Right will begin on its Offering Date and end coincident with the end of\nthe original Offering; and\n(iii) the Board may provide that if such person first becomes an Eligible Employee within a specified period of time before the end of\nthe Offering, he or she will not be granted any Purchase Right under that Offering.\n(c) No Employee will be eligible for the grant of any Purchase Rights if, immediately after any such Purchase Rights are granted, such\nEmployee owns stock possessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of\nany Related Corporation (unless otherwise required by law). For purposes of this Section 5(c), the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code will apply\nin determining the stock ownership of any Employee, and stock which such Employee may purchase under all outstanding Purchase Rights and\noptions will be treated as stock owned by such Employee.\n(d) As specified by Section 423(b)(8) of the Code, an Eligible Employee may be granted Purchase Rights only if such Purchase Rights,\ntogether with any other rights granted under all Employee Stock Purchase Plans of the Company and any Related Corporations, do not permit\nsuch Eligible Employee's rights to purchase stock of the Company or any Related Corporation to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of Fair\nMarket Value of such stock (determined at the time such rights are granted, and which, with respect to the Plan, will be determined as of their\nrespective Offering Dates) for each calendar year in which such rights are outstanding at any time.\n(e) Officers of the Company and any Designated Company, if they are otherwise Eligible Employees, will be eligible to participate in\nOfferings under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may (unless prohibited by law) provide in an Offering that Employees who\nare highly compensated Employees within the meaning of Section 423(b)(4)(D) of the Code will not be eligible to participate.\n6. Purchase Rights; Purchase Price.\n(a) On each Offering Date, each Eligible Employee will be granted a Purchase Right under the applicable Offering to purchase up to that\nnumber of shares of Common Stock purchasable either with a percentage or with a maximum dollar amount, as designated by the Board but in\neither case not exceeding 25%, of such Employee's eligible earnings (as defined by the Board in each Offering) during the period that begins on\nthe Offering Date (or such other date as the Board determines for a particular Offering) and ends on the date stated in the Offering, which date\nwill be no later than the end of the Offering. For clarity, such percentage or maximum dollar amount of such Employee's eligible earnings may be\napplied on the basis of each or any pay-period, Purchase Period or other period during the Offering (including the entire period of the Offering),\nas designated by the Board.\n(b) The Board will establish one or more Purchase Dates during an Offering on which Purchase Rights granted for that Offering will be\nexercised and shares of Common Stock will be purchased in accordance with such Offering.\n(c) In connection with each Offering made under the Plan, the Board may specify (i) a maxi"}

Purchase Rights; Purchase Price.\n(a) On each Offering Date, each Eligible Employee will be granted a Purchase Right under the applicable Offering to purchase up to that\nnumber of shares of Common Stock purchasable either with a percentage or with a maximum dollar amount, as designated by the Board but in\neither case not exceeding 25%, of such Employee's eligible earnings (as defined by the Board in each Offering) during the period that begins on\nthe Offering Date (or such other date as the Board determines for a particular Offering) and ends on the date stated in the Offering, which date\nwill be no later than the end of the Offering. For clarity, such percentage or maximum dollar amount of such Employee's eligible earnings may be\napplied on the basis of each or any pay-period, Purchase Period or other period during the Offering (including the entire period of the Offering),\nas designated by the Board.\n(b) The Board will establish one or more Purchase Dates during an Offering on which Purchase Rights granted for that Offering will be\nexercised and shares of Common Stock will be purchased in accordance with such Offering.\n(c) In connection with each Offering made under the Plan, the Board may specify (i) a maximum number of shares of Common Stock that\nmay be purchased by any Participant on any Purchase Date during such Offering, (ii) a maximum aggregate number of shares of Common\nStock that may be purchased by all Participants pursuant to such Offering, and/or (iii) a maximum aggregate number of shares of Common\nStock that may be purchased by all Participants on any Purchase Date under the Offering. If the aggregate purchase of shares of Common\nStock issuable upon exercise of Purchase Rights granted under the Offering would exceed any such maximum aggregate number, then, in the\nabsence of any Board action otherwise, a pro rata (based on each Participant's accumulated Contributions) allocation of the shares of Common\nStock available will be made in as nearly a uniform manner as will be practicable and equitable.\n(d) The purchase price of each share of Common Stock acquired pursuant to a Participant’s Purchase Right will be not less than the lesser\nof:\n(i) an amount equal to 85% of such Participant’s Offering Date Price; or\n(ii) an amount equal to 85% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Purchase Date.\n7. Participation; Withdrawal; Termination.\n(a) An Eligible Employee may elect to authorize payroll deductions as the means of making Contributions by completing and delivering to\nthe Company, within the time specified in the Offering, an enrollment form provided by the Company. The enrollment form will specify the amount\nof Contributions not to exceed the maximum amount specified by the Board. Each Participant's Contributions will be credited to a bookkeeping\naccount for such Participant under the Plan and will be deposited with the general funds of the Company except where applicable law requires\nthat Contributions be deposited with a third party or otherwise segregated. If permitted in the Offering, a Participant may reduce (including to\nzero) or increase his or her Contributions. If required under applicable law or if specifically provided in the Offering, in addition to or instead of\nmaking Contributions by payroll deductions, a Participant may make Contributions through the payment by cash or check or wire transfer prior to\na Purchase Date, in the manner directed by the Company.\n(b) During an Offering, a Participant may cease making Contributions and withdraw from the Offering by delivering to the Company a\nwithdrawal form provided by the Company. The Company may impose a deadline before a Purchase Date for withdrawing. Upon such\nwithdrawal, such Participant's Purchase Right in that Offering will immediately terminate and the Company will distribute to such Participant all of\nhis or her accumulated but unused Contributions. A Participant's withdrawal from that Offering will have no effect upon his or her eligibility to\nparticipate in any other Offerings under the Plan, but the Participant will be required to deliver a new enrollment form to participate in future\nOfferings.\n(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, Purchase Rights granted pursuant to any Offering under the Plan will terminate\nimmediately if the Participant either (i) is no longer an Employee for any reason or for no reason or (ii) is otherwise no longer eligible to\nparticipate. The Company will distribute to such individual all of his or her accumulated but unused Contributions.\n(d) During a Participant's lifetime, Purchase Rights will be exercisable only by such Participant. Purchase Rights are not transferable by a\nParticipant, except by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or, if permitted by the Company, by a beneficiary designation as described in\nSection 10.\n(e) The Company has no obligation to pay interest on Contributions, unless otherwise required by applicable law.\n8. Exercise of Purchase Rights.\n(a) On each Purchase Date, each Participant's accumulated Contributions will be applied to the purchase of shares of Common Stock, up\nto the maximum number of shares of Common Stock permitted by the Plan and the applicable Offering, at the purchase price specified in the\nOffering. No fractional shares will be issued unless specifically provided for in the Offering.\n(b) If any amount of accumulated Contributions remains in a Participant's account after the purchase of shares of Common Stock on the\nfinal Purchase Date of an Offering and such remaining amount is less than the amount required to purchase one share of Common Stock, then\nsuch remaining amount will be held in such Participant's account for the purchase of shares of Common Stock under the next Offering under the\nPlan, unless such Participant withdraws from or is not eligible to participate in such Offering, in which case such amount will be distributed to\nsuch Participant after the final Purchase Date, without interest (unless otherwise req"}

Exercise of Purchase Rights.\n(a) On each Purchase Date, each Participant's accumulated Contributions will be applied to the purchase of shares of Common Stock, up\nto the maximum number of shares of Common Stock permitted by the Plan and the applicable Offering, at the purchase price specified in the\nOffering. No fractional shares will be issued unless specifically provided for in the Offering.\n(b) If any amount of accumulated Contributions remains in a Participant's account after the purchase of shares of Common Stock on the\nfinal Purchase Date of an Offering and such remaining amount is less than the amount required to purchase one share of Common Stock, then\nsuch remaining amount will be held in such Participant's account for the purchase of shares of Common Stock under the next Offering under the\nPlan, unless such Participant withdraws from or is not eligible to participate in such Offering, in which case such amount will be distributed to\nsuch Participant after the final Purchase Date, without interest (unless otherwise required by applicable law). If the amount of Contributions\nremaining in a Participant's account after the purchase of shares of Common Stock on the final Purchase Date of an Offering is at least equal to\nthe amount required to purchase one whole share of Common Stock, then such remaining amount will not roll over to the next Offering and will\ninstead be distributed in full to such Participant after the final Purchase Date, without interest (unless otherwise required by applicable law).\n(c) No Purchase Rights may be exercised to any extent unless the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon such exercise under the\nPlan are covered by an effective registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act and the Plan is in material compliance with all applicable\nlaws. If on a Purchase Date the shares of Common Stock are not so registered or the Plan is not in such compliance, no Purchase Rights will be\nexercised on such Purchase Date, and the Purchase Date will be delayed until the shares of Common Stock are subject to such an effective\nregistration statement and the Plan is in material compliance, except that the Purchase Date will in no event be more than 27 months from the\nOffering Date. If, on the Purchase Date, as delayed to the maximum extent permissible, the shares of Common Stock are not registered and the\nPlan is not in material compliance with all applicable laws, no Purchase Rights will be exercised and all accumulated but unused Contributions\nwill be distributed to the Participants without interest (unless otherwise required under applicable local law).\n9. Covenants of the Company.\nThe Company will seek to obtain from each federal, state, foreign or other regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan\nsuch authority as may be required to grant Purchase Rights and issue and sell shares of Common Stock thereunder unless doing so would be\nan unreasonable cost to the Company compared to the potential benefit to Eligible Employees which the Company shall determine at its\ndiscretion. If, after commercially reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain the authority that counsel for the Company deems\nnecessary for the grant of Purchase Rights or the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, and at a commercially reasonable\ncost, the Company will be relieved from any liability for failure to grant Purchase Rights and/or to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of\nsuch Purchase Rights.\n10. Designation of Beneficiary.\n(a) The Company may, but is not obligated to, permit a Participant to submit a form designating a beneficiary who will receive any shares of\nCommon Stock and/or Contributions from the Participant's account under the Plan if the Participant dies before such shares and/or Contributions\nare delivered to the Participant. The Company may, but is not obligated to, permit the Participant to change such designation of beneficiary. Any\nsuch designation and/or change must be on a form approved by the Company.\n(b)  If a Participant dies, and in the absence of a valid beneficiary designation, the Company will deliver any shares of Common Stock\nand/or Contributions to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant. If no executor or administrator has been appointed (to the\nknowledge of the Company), the Company, in its sole discretion, may deliver such shares of Common Stock and/or Contributions to the\nParticipant's spouse, dependents or relatives, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the\nCompany may designate.\n11. Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock; Corporate Transactions.\n(a) On a Capitalization Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the class(es) and maximum number of\nsecurities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and number of securities subject to, and the purchase price applicable to\noutstanding Offerings and Purchase Rights; and (iii) the class(es) and number of securities that are the subject of the purchase limits under each\nongoing Offering. The Board will make these adjustments, and its determination will be final, binding and conclusive.\n(b) On a Corporate Transaction, then: (i) any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation's\nparent company) may assume or continue outstanding Purchase Rights or may substitute similar rights (including a right to acquire the same\nconsideration paid to the stockholders in the Corporate Transaction) for outstanding Purchase Rights; or (ii) if any surviving or acquiring\ncorporation (or its parent company) does not assume or continue such Purchase Rights or does not substitute similar rights for such Purchase\nRights, then the Participants' accumul"}

Amendment, Termination or Suspension of the Plan.\n(a) The Board may amend the Plan at any time in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable. However, except as provided in\nSection 11(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment of the Plan for which stockholder\napproval is required by applicable law or listing requirements, including any amendment that either (i) materially increases the number of shares\nof Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) materially expands the class of individuals eligible to become Participants and\nreceive Purchase Rights, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at which\nshares of Common Stock may be purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) expands the types of awards\navailable for issuance under the Plan, but in each of (i) through (v) above only to the extent stockholder approval is required by applicable law or\nlisting requirements.\n(b) The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. No Purchase Rights may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is\nsuspended or after it is terminated.\n(c) Any benefits, privileges, entitlements and obligations under any outstanding Purchase Rights granted before an amendment,\nsuspension or termination of the Plan will not be materially impaired by any such amendment, suspension or termination except (i) with the\nconsent of the person to whom such Purchase Rights were granted, (ii) as necessary to comply with any laws, listing requirements, or\ngovernmental regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 423 of the Code and the regulations and other interpretive\nguidance issued thereunder relating to Employee Stock Purchase Plans) including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that\nmay be issued or amended after the Effective Date, or (iii) as necessary to obtain or maintain favorable tax, listing, or regulatory treatment. To be\nclear, the Board may amend outstanding Purchase Rights without a Participant's consent if such amendment is necessary to ensure that the\nPurchase Right and/or the Plan comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code.\n13. Code Section 409A; Tax Qualification.\n(a) Purchase Rights granted under the 423 Component are intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code under\nTreasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(ii). Purchase Rights granted under the Non-423 Component to U.S. taxpayers are intended to be\nexempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code under the\nshort-term deferral exception and any ambiguities will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Subject to Section 13(b)\nhereof, Purchase Rights granted to U.S. taxpayers under the Non-423 Component will be subject to such terms and conditions that will permit\nsuch Purchase Rights to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral exception available under Section 409A of the Code, including the\nrequirement that the shares subject to a Purchase Right be delivered within the short-term deferral period. Subject to Section 13(b) hereof, in the\ncase of a Participant who would otherwise be subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent the Board determines that a Purchase Right or\nthe exercise, payment, settlement or deferral thereof is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Purchase Right will be granted, exercised, paid,\nsettled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including U.S. Department of Treasury regulations and other\ninterpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the adoption\nof the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the Purchase Right that is\nintended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Board with\nrespect thereto.\n(b) Although the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify a Purchase Right for favorable tax treatment under the laws of the United States or\njurisdictions outside of the United States or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Section 409A of the Code), the Company makes no\nrepresentation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment, notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary"}

No Purchase Rights will be exercised unless and until the Plan has been approved by\nthe stockholders of the Company, which approval must be within 12 months before or after the date the Plan is adopted (or if required under\nSection 12(a) above, materially amended) by the Board.\n15.

Nothing in the Plan or in the Offering will in any way alter the at will\nnature of a Participant's employment, if applicable, or be deemed to create in any way whatsoever any obligation on the part of any Participant to\ncontinue in the employ of the Company or a Related Corporation or an Affiliate, or on the part of the Company or a Related Corporation or an\nAffiliate to continue the employment of a Participant.\n(d) The provisions of the Plan will be governed by the laws of the State of California without resort to that state's conflicts of laws rules.\n(e) If any particular provision of the Plan is found to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will not affect the other provisions\nof the Plan, but the Plan will be construed in all respects as if such invalid provision were omitted.\n16.

If you use a third party to trade on your behalf, you are responsible for\nensuring they adhere to this Policy in any activity they perform for you.\nAny trading activity by persons in your household, family members, or anyone subject to your influence may create an appearance of misconduct, exposing you\nand NVIDIA to significant legal risk.\nPolicy Statement | Responsibilities\n“MNPI” is material, non-public information. Information is material if it would influence a reasonable investor to trade or would significantly alter the total mix of\npublicly available information. Information is non-public if it has not yet been broadly released to the public by way of a press release, conference call, public\nfiling, or similar means of public dissemination.\nWhile most NVIDIA employees work with company confidential information, only a small subset of non-public information rises to the level of MNPI. Examples of\nmaterial information could include: financial results; significant mergers or acquisitions; major contracts; significant information regarding NVIDIA’s products and\nservices; significant information about competition, customers, or market demand; major cybersecurity breaches, data protection or privacy incidents; key\npersonnel changes; significant litigation; or material regulatory activity.\nBLANKET PROHIBITIONS\nFederal and state insider trading laws prohibit transacting in securities of any company when in possession of MNPI relevant to that company.\nFederal and state laws also prohibit “tipping” or disclosing MNPI to third parties who then transact on that information—the tipper can be legally liable even if\nthey do not benefit financially from any transaction.\nThe following additional activities also are restricted at all times, regardless of whether you have MNPI or whether NVIDIA’s trading window (if applicable to you)\nis open:\n• Trading in NVIDIA Derivatives. You may not trade in derivatives of NVIDIA securities, including call and put options.\n• Hedging or Shorting NVIDIA. You may not engage in any form of hedging involving NVIDIA securities, including equity swaps, prepaid forward sale\ncontracts, collars, straddles, or similar instruments. You may not short NVIDIA securities.\n• Purchasing or Holding NVIDIA on Margin. You may not purchase NVIDIA securities on margin or hold them in a margin account.\n• Pledging NVIDIA Securities. You may not pledge NVIDIA securities as collateral for a loan.\n• Providing Information to the Press or Financial Community. Unless you are expressly authorized and are performing your job duties for NVIDIA, you\nmay not provide information to the press or the financial community regarding NVIDIA, competition, customers, market demand, or any other information\nthat could be deemed relevant by stockholders, financial analysts, broker-dealers, or investment research firms.\nADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO “DESIGNATED INDIVIDUALS” ONLY\nDesignated Individuals’ work involves access to financial information that may be material. Check whether you are a Designated Individual in Workday under\n“Current Equity Data”. If you are a Designated Individual, you may not trade in or gift NVIDIA securities during the quarterly closed trading window, which starts\nfive weeks prior to the end of the fiscal quarter and generally reopens on the 2 trading day after the quarter’s earnings results are announced, other than\npursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan (as described below), regardless of whether you have MNPI.\nSPECIAL RESTRICTIONS\nEven if you are not a Designated Individual, NVIDIA may impose a special trading restriction on those who become aware of non-public information that raises a\nrisk of insider trading. You will be notified by Legal if yo"}

You will be notified by Legal if you become subject to a special trading restriction. If so, you may not trade in NVIDIA securities until you\nare notified that the special restriction has ended.\nEXCEPTIONS\nThe prohibited activities above do not apply to:\n• 10b5-1 Trades. Trades pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan already in effect may execute even while you possess MNPI and/or during an applicable closed trading\nwindow. See NVIDIA’s Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan Guidelines for applicable requirements.\nnd\nPolicy Name: Insider Trading Policy    Policy Owner: Legal Application: GlobalLast Updated: 20 FEB 2025; Effective: 22 SEP 2021\nPage 1 of 2\n    \nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\n• Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Vests and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).

Investments in exchange funds using NVIDIA stock may be permitted on a case-by-case basis if the fund is broadly diversified. Contact\nCorporate Legal in advance to review and approve your participation.\n• Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Products. Trading in single-stock exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) for any company’s securities is treated\nas trading in that company’s securities. However, you may trade in mutual funds that invest in, or non-single stock exchange-traded products that contain,\nNVIDIA stock.\n• Gifts. You may gift NVIDIA shares while you possess MNPI and/or during an applicable closed trading window if: (1) the gift is for estate planning purposes\n(such as to family members or a trust you control), (2) you retain beneficial ownership of the shares, (3) the gift recipient complies with this Policy, and (4)\nyou do not have reason to believe that the gift recipient intends to sell the shares while you possess MNPI and/or during an applicable closed trading\nwindow.\nPRECLEARANCE\nSection 16 directors and officers must obtain from Corporate Legal preclearance of any transaction in NVIDIA’s stock.\nCOMPLIANCE | VIOLATIONS and CONSEQUENCES\nThe consequences of violating insider trading laws are severe and could include fines and imprisonment. Additionally, a violation of this Policy may result in\ndiscipline, up to and including termination of employment or engagement with NVIDIA.\nSpeak Up | Reporting Concerns\nIf you are aware of a potential violation of this Policy, report it to Corporate Legal. You may submit a report anonymously by using NVIDIA’s Speak Up system\nthrough EthicsPoint at *-***-***-**** (U.S.) or online. NVIDIA will take appropriate measures to maintain confidentiality and will not retaliate against anyone who\nreports a good faith concern or cooperates with an investigation.\nQuestions\nIf you have questions about this Policy, contact Corporate Legal for guidance before proceeding with any trades or communicating potential MNPI to others.\nPolicy Name: Insider Trading Policy    \nPolicy Owner: Legal\nApplication: Global\nLast Updated: 20 FEB 2025; Effective: 22 SEP 2021\nPage 2 of 2\nEXHIBIT 21.1\nSUBSIDIARIES OF REGISTRANT\nThe following is a list of subsidiaries of NVIDIA Corporation as of January 26, 2025, omitting subsidiaries which, considered in the aggregate,would not constitute a significant subsidiary.\nSubsidiaries of Registrant (All 100% owned) State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation\nMellanox Technologies, Ltd Israel\nNVIDIA International, Inc.

Fiscal years 2025 and 2024 each contain 52 weeks.\nAll period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction\nwith the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nAugust 29, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07 (ASC Topic\n280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU expands on existing reportable segment disclosure requirements\nprimarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for 2025 on a\nretrospective basis. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 (ASC Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires\ndisaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for\n2026 on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 (ASC Topic 220), Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. This ASU requires\ndisclosure of certain expenses in the notes to the financial statements. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for 2028 on a\nprospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n 10\nTable of Contents\nVariable Interest Entities\nCertain third-party special purpose entities (the \"Lease SPEs\") facilitate equipment lease financing transactions between us and various\nfinancial institutions. Neither we nor the financial institutions have an equity interest in the Lease SPEs, which are variable interest entities.\nThe arrangements are financing vehicles and we do not bear any significant risks from variable interests with the Lease SPEs. We do not\ndirect the activities of the Lease SPEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and, as such, we do not consolidate them.\nAs of November 28, 2024, we had approximately $1.03 billion of finance lease liabilities and right-of-use assets under these arrangements.\nCash and Investments\nAll of our short-term investments and long-term marketable investments were classified as available-for-sale as of the dates noted below.\nCash and equivalents and the fair values of our available-for-sale investments, which approximated amortized costs, were as follows:\nAs of November 28, 2024 As of August 29, 2024\nCash andEquivalents Short-termInvestments\nLong-termMarketableInvestments Total FairValue Cash andEquivalents Short-termInvestments\nLong-termMarketableInvestments Total FairValue\nCash $ 6,249 $ — $ — $ 6,249 $ 6,654 $ — $ — $ 6,654 \nLevel 1\nMoney market funds 15 — — 15 20 — — 20 \nLevel 2\nCertificates of deposit 354 — — 354 316 6 — 322 \nCorporate bonds 40 666 671 1,377 — 771 571 1,342 \nAsset-backedsecurities 3 31 429 463 — 46 433 479 \nGovernment securities 26 63 56 145 35 82 42 159 \nCommercial paper 6 135 — 141 16 160 — 176 \n6,693 $ 895 $ 1,156 $ 8,744 7,041 $ 1,065 $ 1,046 $ 9,152 \nRestricted cash 4 11 \nCash, cash equivalents,and restricted cash $ 6,697 $ 7,052 \nThe maturities of long-term marketable investments primarily range from one to five years, except for asset-backed securities which are\nnot due at a single maturity date.\nThe fair value of Level 1 securities is measured based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nThe fair value of Level 2 securities is measured using information obtained from pricing services, which obtain quoted market prices for\nsimilar instruments, non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or various other\nmethodologies, to determine the appropriate value at the measurement date.

Tex. seek injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. On May 23, 2024,\nfollowing a four-day trial regarding the second complaint filed by Netlist in the E.D. Tex., a jury rendered a verdict that Micron’s memory\nmodules infringe two asserted patents — U.S. Patent No. 7,619,912 (“the ‘912 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 11,093,417 (“the ‘417 patent”) —\nand found that Micron should pay $425 million for infringement of the ‘912 patent and $20 million for infringement of the ‘417 patent. Micron\nexpects to appeal the verdict. On April 17, 2024, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark\nOffice (“USPTO”) issued a final written decision (“FWD”) finding unpatentable the sole asserted claim of the ‘912 patent.

Substantially all contracts with our customers are short-\nterm in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. From time to time, we have contracts with initial\nterms that include performance obligations that extend beyond one year. As of November 28, 2024, our future performance obligations\nbeyond one year were $141 million, which included customer prepayments and other contract liabilities.\nAs of November 28, 2024 and August 29, 2024, customer prepayments made to secure product supply in future periods and other contract\nliabilities were $614 million and $907 million, respectively, of which $473 million and $766 million were reported in other current liabilities,\nrespectively. The remainder of the customer prepayments and other contract liabilities were in other noncurrent liabilities. Revenue\nrecognized during the first three months of 2025 from the beginning balance as of August 29, 2024 included $301 million from shipments\nagainst customer prepayments and other contract liabilities.\nAs of November 28, 2024 and August 29, 2024, other current liabilities included $858 million and $718 million, respectively, for estimates of\nconsideration payable to customers including estimates for pricing adjustments and returns.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:\nThree months ended November 28, 2024 November 30, 2023\nIncome (loss) before taxes $ 2,152 $ (1,155)\nIncome tax (provision) benefit (283) (73)\nEffective tax rate 13.2 % (6.3)%\nFor the first quarter of 2024, our tax expense was based on actual results for jurisdictions where small changes in our projected pre-taxincome would have caused significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we wereable to estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method for all jurisdictions.\nThe change in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to changes in\nprofitability and the calculation of our tax expense using actual results in the first quarter of 2024.\nWe operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These\nincentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in\n 22\nTable of Contents\npart, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax\nprovision by $212 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.19) for the first quarter of 2025.

Witha relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, manufacturing, and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio ofhigh-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, theinnovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and compute-intensive applicationsthat unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience.\nWe manufacture our products at wholly-owned facilities and also utilize subcontractors for certain manufacturing processes. Our global\nnetwork of manufacturing centers of excellence not only allows us to benefit from scale while streamlining processes and operations, but it\nalso brings together some of the world’s brightest talent to work on the most advanced memory technology. Centers of excellence bring\nexpertise together in one location, providing an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in\npartnership with teams such as research and development (“R&D”), product development, human resources, procurement, and supply chain.\nFor our locations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing together. We make\nsignificant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally increases bit density per wafer and reduces\nper-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved\nperformance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved\nread/write reliability, and increased memory density.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive we must continuously develop and\nimplement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of inflationary pressures. Our success is largely\ndependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration\nof advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage\nsolutions, and efficient capital spending.\nProduct Technologies\nOur product portfolio of memory and storage solutions, advanced solutions, and storage platforms is based on our high-performance\nsemiconductor memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND, and NOR. We sell our products through our business units into\nvarious markets in numerous forms, including: components, modules, SSDs, managed NAND, multi-chip packages, and wafers. Many of our\nsystem-level solutions combine NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases DRAM.\nDRAM: DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide high-speed data retrieval\nwith a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is turned off (“volatile”) and are most commonly used\nin the data center, client PC, graphics, industrial, and automotive markets.\nNAND: NAND products are non-volatile, re-writeable semiconductor storage devices that provide high-capacity, low-cost storage with a\nvariety of performance characteristics. NAND is used in SSDs for the data center, client PC, consumer, and automotive markets and in\nremovable storage markets. Managed NAND is used in smartphones and other mobile devices, and in consumer, automotive, and\nembedded markets. Low-density NAND is ideal for applications like automotive, surveillance, machine-to-machine, automation, printer, and\nhome networking.\n 26\nTable of Contents\nNOR: NOR products are non-volatile, re-writable semiconductor memory devices that provide fast read speeds. NOR is most commonly\nused for reliable code storage (e.g., boot, application, operating system, and execute-in-place code in an embedded system) and for\nfrequently changing small data storage and is ideal for automotive, industrial, and consumer applications.\nIndustry Conditions\nThroughout 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, we experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins for DRAM. Increasing\ndemand growth, driven in part by deployment of AI and mostly normal customer inventories, combined with industry-wide supply discipline,\nresulted in a substantially improved industry supply and demand balance.

Leading edge DRAM demand remains tight, driven by HBM supply\nramp in the industry. In the PC, smartphone, and consumer markets, our bit shipments are expected to be weaker until inventories in these\nmarkets reach healthier levels expected in the spring. In line with prior plans, we shifted our supply to meet the strong demand in data center\nDRAM resulting in a portfolio mix weighted more towards high growth and less seasonal segments.\nWe also experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins for NAND throughout 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, after several\nquarters of very robust revenue, NAND shipments and prices decreased as customers worked to reduce inventories to align with demand in\ntheir end markets. As NAND technology node transitions provide increases in bit output, the pace of technology transitions will need to slow\nto align supply to industry demand. We are taking prompt and decisive action to align our NAND supply with industry demand trends,\nincluding reducing NAND wafer starts and NAND capital expenditures.\nRecent Developments\nIn December 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding\npursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Idaho and two planned fabs in New York, as well as a non-binding preliminary memorandum\nof terms for up to $275 million in direct funding for our fab in Virginia.

These\nincentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations\nand employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $212 million (benefiting our diluted\nearnings per share by $0.19) for the first quarter of 2025. As a result of the low levels of profitability and jurisdictional mix of income, the\nbenefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the periods presented for 2024.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar\nTwo Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Nearly all European\nUnion member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in 2025. We do not expect these enacted laws to\nmaterially impact our effective tax rate for 2025. On November 27, 2024, Singapore enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two, which will\napply to us starting in 2026. While we are still evaluating the impacts, we expect our effective tax rate for 2026 to be in the high-teens\npercentage range. We also continue to monitor for additional guidance and legislative changes to Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we\noperate.\nVarious tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could materially impact our tax\nexpense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and\nfinancial statements.\nOther: Further information related to our operating expenses and other can be found in “Item 1.

Following the\nenactment of the CHIPS Act, we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fab facilities in the United States,\nbased on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a\nleading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with meaningful DRAM output\nprojected in 2027. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing facility, consisting\nof up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect construction site preparation to begin in calendar\n2025, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements\nfor additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends and our objective of\nmaintaining stable bit share.\nOn December 9, 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in directfunding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Boise, Idaho and two planned fabs in Clay, New York. On December 9, 2024, we alsosigned a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for up to $275 million in direct funding for our fab in Manassas, Virginia. See “Item 1.Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” We elected not to pursue the federalloans previously disclosed as included in the non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for the Boise, Idaho and Clay, New York fabs.\nIn addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We\nhave also signed a non-binding term sheet with the State of New York that provides up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab\nfacility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job\nwages.\nAdditionally, we began enablement of cleanroom space within our existing manufacturing fab in Hiroshima, Japan, that will support\nproduction of advanced DRAM using EUV lithography. We also continue to advance our global back-end assembly and test network in order\nto support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. We have started construction to\nexpand our existing assembly and test facility in Xi’an, China, to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve\nmore of the demand from our customers in China. Construction is also progressing for the assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to\naddress demand in the latter half of this decade.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-\nmarket purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.

In some prior periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may\nexperience such circumstances in the future. Average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs have recently had an\nadverse effect on our business and results of operations, and in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations, or financial condition.\nOur gross margins may be adversely affected by a range of factors.\nIn addition to the impact of our average selling prices, our gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing decreases in per gigabit\nmanufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs. Factors that may limit our ability\nto reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins include, but are not\nlimited to:\n• strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix;\n• increasing complexity of our product portfolio, which may impact operational costs;\n• increasing complexity of manufacturing processes;\n• difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies or additional 3D memory layers or NAND cell levels;\n• process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps;\n• manufacturing yield and defect density;\n• technological barriers;\n• changes in process technologies;\n• new products that may require relatively larger die sizes or advanced packaging technologies;\n• start-up or other costs associated with capacity expansions;\n• higher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures or market conditions; and\n• higher manufacturing costs per gigabit due to fabrication facility underutilization, lower wafer output, and insufficient volume to run\nnew technology nodes to achieve cost optimization.\nMany factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which have in the past and could in the future lead to\nunderutilization of our production assets. These factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply,\ninventory surpluses, difficulties in ramping emerging technologies, supply chain disruptions, and delays from equipment suppliers. A\nsignificant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. As a result, lower\nutilization, lower wafer output, and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs could result in higher inventory carrying\ncosts, and have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nWe have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs, which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid\ntechnological changes. Our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they are largely influenced by the\ntechnology node in which the solution was developed. We strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the\ndynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels.\nConsequently, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would\nreduce our gross margins. For example, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our\ninventories to their estimated net realizable value. In addition, due to the customized nature of certain products we manufacture, we may be\nunable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications,\nwhich may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods.\n 36\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, if we are unable to supply products that meet customer design and performance specifications, we may be required to sell such\nproducts at lower average selling prices, which may reduce our gross ma"}

Our gross margins may also be impacted by shifts in product\nmix, driven by our strategy to optimize our portfolio to best respond to changing market dynamics.\nWe may not be able to predict or quickly respond to trends in the dynamics of our markets and our customers or changes in customer\ndemand, which could negatively impact our gross margin. Our inability to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, and\nIndia, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. In 2024, nearly half of our revenue was from sales to\ncustomers who have headquarters located outside the United States, while over 80% of our revenue in 2024 was from products shipped to\ncustomer locations outside the United States.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n• restrictions on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers;\n• export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the\ntransfer of funds, including currency controls in China and tariffs in the United States, which could negatively affect the amount and\ntiming of payments from certain of our customers and, as a result, our cash flows;\n• compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977,\nas amended, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations;\n• theft of intellectual property;\n• political and economic instability, including instability resulting from domestic and international conflicts;\n• government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials, including delays in shipping and obtaining products\nand materials, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products;\n• problems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials;\n• issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest;\n• longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n• compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;\n• contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels;\n• disruptions to manufacturing or R&D activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments;\n• changes in economic policies of foreign governments;\n• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n• public health issues.\nIf we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by any of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, or financial condition.\nFollowing the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information\ninfrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland\nChina and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government,\nthrough CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products\nto our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n37 | 2025 Q1 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the U.S. government has in the past and continues to restrict American firms, including us, from selling products and software to\ncertain of our customers and may in the future impose similar restrictions on one or more of our significant customers.

A majority of our DRAM production output in 2024 was\nfrom our fabrication facilities in Taiwan, and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect on us. Any political, economic, or other\nactions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result,\ncould have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia HoldingsCorporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to\nobtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greaterresources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which wecompete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased\nmanufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. Alternatively, new entrants into memory and storage market could have a significantadverse impact on our competitive position. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorablechanges in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to\nsome of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. As a result, we face the\nthreat of increasing competition and oversupply due to significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and\nvarious state-owned or affiliated entities, such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”) and ChangXin Memory Technologies,\nInc. (“CXMT”). In addition, the CAC’s decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products\nhad an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere.\nWe and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and reduce die size, which\ncould result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor\nmemory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or\nreallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital\nexpenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or\nramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by\ncommensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect\nour business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to\nshortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. If competitors are more successful at developing or\nimplementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages.\nThe competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n 38\nTable of Contents\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and\nproducts.\nOur key semiconductor memory and storage technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. These\nbarriers include achieving acceptable yields and quality for HBM products with their multiple chip layers, potential limitations on stacking\nadditional 3D memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, developing advanced packaging\nsolutions, improving power consumption and reliability, and delivering advanced features and higher performance.

Such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our\ncosts and production output. We may be unable to recover our investment in R&D or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die\nsize or increasing memory and storage densities. Our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may\noffer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our future success\nmay depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies.\nWe are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional\nproducts or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new semiconductor\nproduct and system-level solution development. We are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands\nof our customers, which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers.\nRecent technologies, such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for HBM and other\nadvanced products in the data center and other markets, the long-term trajectory is unknown and associated demand may fluctuate. As a\nresult, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. In addition, our ability to\nsuccessfully introduce new products often requires us to make product specification decisions multiple years in advance of when new\nproducts enter the market.\nIt is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers\nare designing and evaluating samples for their products. If we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may exclude us\nfrom further consideration as a supplier for those products. The process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced\nfunctionality, performance, and reliability, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our\ncustomers. Many factors may negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with\nrespect to the development of certain of our products. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders\nup to a year in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our\nforecasts vary substantially from actual demand.\nThere can be no assurance of the following:\n• we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and products;\n• we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products;\n• we will be able to successfully market these technologies;\n• margins and cash flows generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts;\n• we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain\ncustomers, for specific chip set or design requirements;\n• we will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers' specifications; or\n• we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis.\nUnsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, or financial condition.\n39 | 2025 Q1 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to achieve expected returns from capacity expansions.\nWe have commenced expansion of our production capacity in the United States and in other regions where we operate.

Concurrent semiconductor expansion\nprojects across the industry introduce significant competition for the limited pool of construction talent with requisite expertise and experience\nin these regions. As such, expanding production capacity in the United States and certain other regions may introduce more challenges than\nwe would experience in geographies with more established ecosystems.\nIn addition, these expansions involve several risks including the following:\n• inability to meet capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions, including during periods of relatively low free cash flow\ngeneration, resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions;\n• unavailability of necessary funding, which may include external sources;\n• inability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through the CHIPS Act and\nother national, international, state, and local grants;\n• potential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including the CHIPS Act;\n• delays and potential restrictions related to environmental and other government regulations or permits;\n• potential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies;\n• inability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget;\n• inability to attract, retain and motivate key talent;\n• inability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner;\n• increases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale; and\n• insufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced impacts from certain of the above items and, because these risks are a characteristic of our\nbusiness, we expect to experience them in the future. Depending on the nature and extent of the impact from these risks, we may be unable\nto produce sufficient capacity in the expected time frame which could result in delays in the completion of our construction projects and\nincreased costs, including costs to operate these facilities.\nWe invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns. Investments in capital\nexpenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. Significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will\nresult in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in\ncompletion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to\nrealize expected returns on our capital expenditures.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n 40\nTable of Contents\nOur incentives from various governments are conditioned upon achieving or maintaining certain outcomes and satisfying\ncompliance requirements and are subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and could impose certain limitations on our\nbusiness.\nWe have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in variousregions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, research and development, or\nproduction in those regions.

For example, in December 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements, providing funds for the construction of fab facilities inIdaho and New York, with the United States Department of Commerce (the “Department”) under the Department’s CHIPS IncentivesProgram established pursuant to the CHIPS Act. The awards under the direct funding agreements are subject to various conditions and wemay not receive the funding expected on the same terms or at all. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve or maintainoutcomes or satisfy the compliance requirements to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide or continue toprovide such funding. See “Part I. Financial Information –Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.”\nThese incentive arrangements, including the funding agreements, typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance\nwith their terms and obligations. Such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. In addition,\nthe incentives we receive, including the funding agreements, are in some cases subject to reduction, termination, or clawback under certain\ncircumstances, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nOur business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the availability and quality of materials,\nsupplies, electrical power, water, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers.\nOur supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to\nprovide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a\nlimited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some\ncases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a\ntimely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead\nframes, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw\nmaterials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times\nhave occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the\nfuture because of the nature of the industry. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could\nlimit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n41 | 2025 Q1 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nOur manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits,\nand other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of maintenance for our advanced semiconductor\nmanufacturing equipment and providers of electricity and other utilities.

Any power\nshortages, capacity constraints, prolonged outages, or significant or unexpected increases in the cost of power could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to\nlower cost manufacturing processes. For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a\nsingle supplier. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited\ncapacity. Our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing\nprocesses and reduce our costs. Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production and could increase our\noverall costs of a ramp. Our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur construction projects to expand production and R&D capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor, materials, equipment,\nand services.

Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers,\nsmartphones, automobiles, and servers. Reduced demand for these or other products could result in significant decreases in our average\nselling prices and product sales. In addition, to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels or are impacted by a\ndeterioration in credit markets, we may experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand resulting in industry oversupply and\ndeclines in pricing for our products.\nA deterioration of conditions in regional or worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations\nand capital expenditures. In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial\ninstitutions and other parties. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit\ndefaults. Additionally, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay, or\ncancel plans to purchase our products. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely\naffect our earnings and cash flow. As a result, downturns in regional or worldwide economies could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and\ncontinuous modification to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix\ncan reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. We and our subcontractors maintain\noperations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in\nmultiple locations in several countries including the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and China. As a result of the\nnecessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s\nfacilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products.\nFrom time to time, there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages, improperly functioning\nequipment and facilities, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. We have manufacturing and other\noperations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes, such as severe and variable weather and geological\nevents resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate\nchange may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that\ncould result in supply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious\ndiseases, may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines, closures of production\nfacilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping.

This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of\nrevenue, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with certain customers and end markets.\nApproximately one-half of our total revenue comes from our top ten customers. On end markets, approximately one-half of our total revenueis currently concentrated in the data center end market. A disruption in our relationship with any of our top customers or a significant\ndecrease in demand for our data center products, or in the overall data center end market, could adversely affect our business. We couldexperience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer or end market, as markets and strategies evolve. Demandfor our products may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. Our inability to qualify our products to meet customer or end market\nrequirements could adversely impact our revenue. A meaningful change in inventory strategy by our top customers or in certain end marketscould impact our industry bit demand growth outlook. In addition, consolidation impacting our customers or in significant end markets couldlimit the opportunity for sale of our products. The loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one or more of our major customers or in\ncertain end markets, or any significant reduction in orders or a shift in product mix, could have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations, or financial condition. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements – Certain Concentrations.”\nIncreases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop, qualify,\nand manufacture our system solutions.\nOur development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our\ncustomers’ specifications for those products. Developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer\nincreases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. Even if our\nproducts meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over\nthose of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. Our competitors’ products may be less costly, provide\nbetter performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. Our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and\nstorage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at\nsufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nManufacturing system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and HBM, typically results in higher per-unit manufacturing costs and\nlonger cycle time as compared to other products. Even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient\nvolume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs are not offset by higher per-unit selling prices.\nManufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to\ndesign, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. Some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware\nthat may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. Additionally, we\nmay need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product\nintroductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. System complexities and extended\nwarranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs.

Many customer programs require\nus to remove a supplier within a prescribed period if such supplier ceases to comply with prescribed criteria, and our supply chain may at any\ntime contain suppliers at risk of being removed due to non-compliance with responsible sourcing requirements. Some of our customers may\nelect to disqualify us as a supplier (resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer) or reduce purchases from us if we\nare unable to verify that our performance or products (including the underlying supply chain) meet the specifications of our customers’\nresponsible sourcing programs on a continuous basis. Meeting responsible sourcing requirements may increase operating requirements and\ncosts or limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such\nmaterials, supplies, and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. From time to time, we remove suppliers or require our\nsuppliers to remove suppliers from their supply chains based on our responsible sourcing requirements or customer requirements, and we or\nour suppliers may be unable to replace such removed suppliers in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any inability to replace removed\nsuppliers in a timely or cost effective manner may affect our ability and/or the cost to obtain sufficient quantities of materials, supplies, and\nservices necessary for the manufacture of our products. Our inability to replace suppliers we have removed in a timely or cost-effective\nmanner or comply with customers’ responsible sourcing requirements or with any related regulations could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n47 | 2025 Q1 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nFailure to meet environmental, social, and governance expectations or standards or achieve our related goals could adversely\naffect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance matters, including\ngreenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, sustainability, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity,\nequality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility.

Despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future\ncompetitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. The\nlaws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do U.S. laws, and our confidentiality, non-\ndisclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. The use of AI in the development of our\nproducts and services could also cause loss of intellectual property, as well as subject us to risks related to intellectual property infringement\nor misappropriation.\nAdditionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled\nemployees. If our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the\nknowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment, and this may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and\ndevelop intellectual property.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nLegal, regulatory and administrative investigations, inquiries, proceedings, and claims could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various legal, regulatory and administrative investigations, inquiries, proceedings, and claims that arise\nout of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. Such claims, investigations, inquiries, and\nproceedings may include, but are not limited to, allegations of anticompetitive conduct and infringement of intellectual property. See “Part I.\nFinancial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.”\nWe may be associated with and subject to litigation, claims, inquiries, investigations or disputes arising from, or as a result of:\n• our relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business\npartners;\n• the actions of our vendors, subcontractors, or business partners;\n• our indemnification obligations, including obligations to defend our customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of\ncertain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets; and\n• the terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims.\nAs we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmentedreality, AI, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers’ use of thoseproducts. We, our officers, or our directors could also be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws.

We\nare unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. Any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject\nus to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management’s time and attention. As a\nresult of these claims, we may be required to:\n• pay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties;\n• enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights;\n• make material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or\n• cease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes\nin certain jurisdictions.\nWe may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1.\nFinancial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.”\nWe have a number of intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic\npayments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether\nthese license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nGovernment actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to sell\nour products to certain customers or markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations.\nInternational trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and military conflicts have led, and continue to lead, to new and increasing exportrestrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other trade measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive,\nreduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure, or increase our costs for,components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, impede our ability to perform R&D activities, orotherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. Government actions in the United States or abroad may lead to further changes in trade\npolicy, domestic sourcing initiatives, increases in foreign government incentives supporting domestic businesses or other formal and informalmeasures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and/or customers. For example,following the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information\ninfrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainlandChina and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government,through CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products\nto our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n51 | 2025 Q1 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nWe cannot predict what actions may be taken with respect to export regulations, tariffs, or other trade regulations between the United Statesand other countries, what products or companies may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries inretaliation. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, andraw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs,decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment andsupplies. For example, increasing geopolitical tensions have in the past and could in the future result in new export controls associated withproducts, including those that support or enable AI applications, which could, in turn, restrict future sales of certain products to China or othermarkets.

Any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, orfinancial condition.\nThe technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government\ninvestigations, legal actions, and penalties. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with\napplicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies.\nViolations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees;\nprohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.\nTax-related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in\nthe future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions,\nchallenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations\nwith respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,\nadverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nChanges to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could\nsignificantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion\nand profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in\n2025. We do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025. On November 27, 2024, Singapore enacted\nlegislation to implement Pillar Two, which will apply to us starting in 2026. While we are still evaluating the impacts, we expect our effective\ntax rate for 2026 to be in the high-teens percentage range. We also continue to monitor for additional guidance and legislative changes\nrelated to Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we operate.\nWe and others are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, or industry standards, including with respect to\nenvironmental, health, safety, and product considerations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nThe manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, chemicals, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws\nand regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes increasing regulations on a class of chemicals known as per-\nand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction,\nmaintenance, and operations of our facilities. Any changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct\ncosts, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations\nand financial condition.

Such laws,\nregulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting\nfrom our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nNew and evolving laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy, and AI impose requirements for information confidentiality,\nintegrity, availability, personal and proprietary data collection, storage, use, sharing, deletion, and AI systems to be appropriately transparent,\nfair, secure, beneficial, and accountable. Such laws, standards, and market expectations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for\ncompliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or partners reluctance to share information or\nsolutions due to actual or perceived inadequate controls. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the considerations detailed in this risk factor, we could experience the following:\n• suspension of production or sales of our products;\n• limited supplies of chemicals or materials used to make our products;\n• remediation costs;\n• increased compliance costs;\n• alteration of our manufacturing processes;\n• regulatory penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and other legal liabilities; and\n• reputational challenges.\nCompliance with, or our failure, or the failure of our third-party sales channel partners or agents, to comply with, laws, regulations, or industry\nstandards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make\nscheduled debt payments, pay our dividend, and make adequate capital investments.\nOur cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices,\nand manufacturing costs. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and\nmaintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and\nproduct and process technology. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from\ngovernment incentives, to be approximately $14 billion plus or minus $500 million.\nIn the past, we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, prevailing\ninterest rates, and general capital market and other economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to\nus or at all. We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and we expect to continue to experience such volatility in\nthe future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk,\nor other factors, which may increase the cost of borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of\nfinancing to fund our operations, make debt payments, refinance our debt, pay our quarterly dividend, and make adequate capital\ninvestments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have\na material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n53 | 2025 Q1 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nDebt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and to realign\nour capital structure. As of November 28, 2024, we had debt with a carrying value of $13.79 billion and may incur additional debt, including\nunder our $2.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility. Our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows:\n• require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow\navailable to fund our business activities;\n• adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs and reduce our ability to raise funds on favorable terms;\n• limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, R&D, and other general\ncorporate requirements;\n• restrict our ability to incur specified indebte"}

This, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors\nas well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or\nthat additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other\nliquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down\nconditions and utilize our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations\nor satisfy our debt covenants, we may need to refinance, restructure, or amend the terms of our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital\ninvestments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet\nour debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nAcross our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting\ncurrency), primarily the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and\nSingapore dollar. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in some of the foreign currencies mentioned\nabove. Exchange rates for some of these currencies against the U.S. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. If these\ncurrencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar that\nadversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition.\nWe are subject to counterparty default risks.\nWe have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits,\ninvestments, and derivative instruments. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable\nfrom them. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations. A counterparty may not\ncomply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit\nour ability to mitigate our exposure. Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual\narrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for\nbankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the\ncounterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such default, we could incur significant losses,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n 54\nTable of Contents\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nOur common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future.

Investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may\nlose some or all of their investment. Volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action\nlitigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.\nThe amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the\nshares under our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could\nalso increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nThe amount, frequency, and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on ouroperating results, cash flows, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and priorities for the use of cash for\nother purposes. See “Part I. Financial Information –Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS ActFunding Agreements.” Our expenditures for these share repurchases were $300 million in 2024, $425 million in 2023, $2.43 billion in 2022,$1.20 billion in 2021, $176 million in 2020, and $2.66 billion in 2019. These other purposes include, but are not limited to, operational\nspending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of debt. Other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our sharerepurchases. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, theauthorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the shares under our share repurchase authorization or that it will enhance long-term\nshareholder value. The repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of\na pause in, or termination of, this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program is a use of cash,\nwhich may reduce the availability of cash for other business purposes, including investments, acquisitions, dividends, or repayment of\nindebtedness.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a\nquarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be\ndiscontinued or reduced at any time.

All intercompany balancesand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reportedamounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, includingthose related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other\ncharges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe arereasonable.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of\ninformation in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We are currently assessing theeffect of the adoption of this standard on our disclosures that will be included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 25, 2026.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included withineach income statement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this\nstandard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.\nNote 2 - Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense includes restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, market-based PSUs, and our employee stock\npurchase plan, or ESPP.\n9\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized into inventory, as follows:\n Three Months Ended Six Months Ended\n Jul 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024 Jul 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024\n(In millions)\nCost of revenue $ 58 $ 40 $ 123 $ 75 \nResearch and development 1,191 832 2,254 1,559 \nSales, general and administrative 375 282 722 530 \nTotal $ 1,624 $ 1,154 $ 3,099 $ 2,164 \nEquity Award Activity\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding\n Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date FairValue Per Share\n(In millions, except per share data)\nBalance as of Jan 26, 2025 274 $ 44.75 \nGranted 48 $ 108.52 \nVested (78)$ 36.00 \nCanceled and forfeited (5) $ 52.34 \nBalance as of Jul 27, 2025 239 $ 60.19 \nAs of July 27, 2025, aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense was $14.0 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average\nperiod of 2.2 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and one year for ESPP.\nNote 3 - Net Income Per Share\nThe following is the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:\n Three Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJul 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024 Jul 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024\n (In millions, except per share data)\nNumerator:   \nNet income $ 26,422 $ 16,599 $ 45,197 $ 31,480 \nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average shares 24,366 24,578 24,404 24,599 \nDilutive impact of outstanding equity awards 166 270 167 270 \nDiluted weighted average shares 24,532 24,848 24,571 24,869 \nNet income per share:\nBasic (1) $ 1.08 $ 0.68 $ 1.85 $ 1.28 \nDiluted (2) $ 1.08 $ 0.67 $ 1.84 $ 1.27 \nAnti-dilutive equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share3 5 60 68 \n(1)    Net income divided by basic weighted average shares.\n(2)    Net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.\nDiluted net income per share was computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, usingthe treasury stock method.\n10\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nNote 4 - Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $4.8 billion and $2.6 billion for the second quarter, and $7.9 billion and $5.0 billion for the first half, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,respectively.

Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 15.3% and 13.6% for the second quarter, and 14.9% and 13.7% for\nthe first half, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from foreign-derived deduction eligible income.\nOur effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits fromforeign-derived deduction eligible income, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal\nstatutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.\nIn July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was enacted into law and contains several changes to key U.S. federal income tax laws. As of July 27,2025, we have recognized the tax effects of certain OBBBA provisions, which did not have a material impact on our second quarter.\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in thenear term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could\nvary based on our assessment of all available information.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the positionwill be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.

OnDecember 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States and the Supreme Court’s final disposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, theSupreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme Court dismissed NVIDIA’s writ ofcertiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued judgment on January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment,\nentered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed\nJanuary 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In ReNVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case oncethe appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims,\npurportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, andviolations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel\ninventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms andimprovements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et\nal. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In ReNVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On March 7, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company’s petition for writ of\ncertiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Securities Litigation action, the district court adopted the parties' stipulation to extend the stay until thefinal and complete resolution of the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of thegaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, anddigital twin applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nRevenue growth in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated\ncomputing and AI solutions. Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the first half of the year, including our transition to Blackwell Ultra platforms.\nIn April 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that a license is required for exports of our H20 product into the China market. As a result of these newrequirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the\ndemand for H20 diminished. In August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, butto date, we have not generated any revenue or shipped any H20 products under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will\nreceive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. In the secondquarter, we recognized approximately $650 million of H20 revenue from sales to an unrestricted customer outside of China, resulting in a $180 million release ofpreviously reserved H20 inventory. There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.\nWe continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We began shippingproduction units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms including GB300 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated\nsystem configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased\n24\ninventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new\ntechnologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses. The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundationmodels is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is beco"}

This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased\n24\ninventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new\ntechnologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses. The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundationmodels is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly important across the ecosystem and it is dependent ondeveloper adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the\ninfluence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services. Future demand for our platform will depend on ourability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large language models—across our full stack of software and\nhardware offerings.\nThe availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of theseresources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.\nIn January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on our mostpopular data center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement\na replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on ourproducts or operations and/or add license requirements that could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe rapid evolution of global trade policies, such as new export controls and tariffs, has added complexity and increased costs throughout our supply chain, and\nthese challenges are likely to persist. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions byus and our partners, disrupt supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and\ndemand.\nWe plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected tostrengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing\ncapabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.\nMacroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and\ngeopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate andquantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of ourinvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously\nmanage product availability and costs with our vendors.\nRefer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSecond Quarter of Fiscal Year 2026 Summary\nThree Months Ended Quarter-over-QuarterChange Year-over-YearChange Jul 27, 2025 Apr 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nRevenue $ 46,743 $ 44,062 $ 30,040 6 % 56 %\nGross margin 72.4 % 60.5 % 75.1 % 11.9  pts (2.7) pts\nOperating expenses $ 5,413 $ 5,030 $ 3,932 8 % 38 %\nOperating income $ 28,440 $ 21,638 $ 18,642 31 % 53 %\nNet income $ 26,422 $ 18,775 $ 16,599 41 % 59 %\nNet income per diluted share $ 1.08 $ 0.76 $ 0.67 42 % 61 %\nWe benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestrictedcustomer outside of China.

The year over year increase in Graphics segment operating income in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026 was driven by thegrowth in revenue.\nConcentration of Revenue\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, andsystem integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system\nintegrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs,consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\nDirect Customers – For the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 23% of total revenue; and sales to a\nsecond direct customer, Customer B, represented 16% of total revenue, respectively, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Forthe first half of fiscal year 2026, sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 20% of total revenue; and sales to a second direct customer, CustomerB, represented 15% of total revenue, respectively, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nSales to four direct customers represented 14%, 11%, 11%, and 10% of revenue for the second quarter, and sales to three direct customers represented 14%,10%, and 10% of revenue for the first half, of fiscal year 2025, all of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nIndirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, productspecifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. Indirect customers primarily purchase ourproducts through system integrators and distributors. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, two indirect customers—primarily purchasing our products\nthrough Direct Customers A and B—are each estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue and attributable to the\n27\nCompute & Networking segment. For the first half of fiscal year 2026, one indirect customer—primarily purchasing through Direct Customer A—is estimated torepresent 10% or more of total revenue and attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nWe estimate that in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our\nrevenue, through various direct and indirect customers.\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location of direct customers even if the estimated revenue may be attributable to indirect\ncustomers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 50% and 51% of total revenue for the secondquarter and first half of fiscal year 2026, respectively, and 57% and 53% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test\nyield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-relatedintangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to\npersonnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margins decreased to 72.4% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 75.1% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, and 66.6% for thefirst half of fiscal year 2026 compared to 76.6% for the first half of fiscal year 2025, as our Blackwell revenue consists primarily of full-scale datacenter systems\ncompared to Hopper HGX systems last year. Gross margin for the first half of fiscal year 2026 was also impacted by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20excess inventory and purchase obligations.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $1.0 billion and $6.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026,respectively, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.

Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements forfurther information.\nOther than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligationsfrom those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025\nfor a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Notes 10,11, and 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, respectively.\nClimate Change\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcingrenewable energy or climate-related business trends.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThere has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nFinancial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025. Our marketable equity securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, whileour non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies.\nPublicly-held equity securities are subject to market price volatility. A hypothetical 10% decrease in our publicly-held equity securities would decrease the fair\nvalue of the publicly-held equity securities balance as of July 27, 2025 by $320 million.\nNon-marketable equity securities are measured based on cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactionsfor an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are inherently complex due to the lack of readily\navailable market data and observable transactions, and impact of macroeconomic factors.\nFor a description of our equity investments, refer to Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, respectively.\n31\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures AboutMarket Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.

We are continuing a phased upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or\nERP, system to update our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operatingresults. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internalcontrols, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\nPart II. Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nRefer to Part I, Item 1, Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legalproceedings since January 26, 2025. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 for\na prior discussion of our legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOther than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 27, 2025.\nPurchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 27, 2025, and below. Any\none of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additionalrisks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results ofoperations or reputation.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrateacquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\nWe acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives.Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our productsand ultimately could have a negative impact on our\n32\nfinancial results.

Regulators could also\nimpose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions is harmed,future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Our investments in publicly traded and private companies could create volatility and fluctuationsin our results. These investments may generate realized and unrealized gains or losses and we could realize losses up to the value of the investments. In\naddition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives.These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the securities in which we invest are non-marketable and\nilliquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are notsuccessful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, anda decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses.\nWe face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’sattention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in\nobtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisitionor investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or areacquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n• difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key\npersonnel, of the acquired business;\n• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n• integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n• coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n• stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an\nacquisition;\n• potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or\nother restrictions;\n• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n• exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and\ncostly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processeswith our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of\noperations and may continue to do so in the future.\n33\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export of our products, which may\nadversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls\nand cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; productregulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws.\nCompliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operationsand ability to manufacture and ship our products.

There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violateapplicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines,\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws,rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs,\nand/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliancecosts as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurityvulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European\nUnion, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from usregarding our business and competition in the graphics card and CSP market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also\nreceived, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom,China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments,partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies,\nroadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. Weexpect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests have been and are likely to be expensive and burdensome and could negativelyimpact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.\nGovernments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to developfrontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year\ntransitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have alreadyenacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of\nnew systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions tolaws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties\nor tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact thetiming of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negativelyimpact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import orexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or\nother trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an exportlicense with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or\nsanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties availableunder the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which\nblocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales toRussia and closed business o"}

In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales toRussia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable ofenabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\n34\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,\ntuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and usersworldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.\nAs geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export controlrestrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associatedproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and\napplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing andwarehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our\nbusiness, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasinglylikely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject tosimilar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and\nsemiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale,repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide\nservices such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end customers, evenoutside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China\nand for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for ourproducts, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to\nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impactingour business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls has and could in the future lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related\nsupply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of ourresearch and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to\nserve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provideour products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue.

For example,\nregulators in China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. Ifregulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties,restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, restrictions or other orders regarding our networking business, products, and services, or otherwise impact our\noperations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOver the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, impacting our ability to serve customers outside\nthe United States.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor andsupercomputing industries. These restrictions impacted exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,\nproduce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed\nus of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries inthe Middle East.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D:1, D:4, and\nD:5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performancethresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S RTX 4090, GB200 NVL72, and B200. The licensing requirements also apply\nto the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,including China.\n35\nOn April 9, 2025, the USG informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companiesheadquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnectbandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with\nH20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 products diminished.\nThe export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance\ndensity” of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s datacenter market that receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/computemarket, with a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to controls targeting D:1, D:4 and D:5 countries, the USG has also imposed worldwide export controls impacting our products, and may imposeadditional controls in the future.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on ourdata center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. The AI Diffusion IFR would have divided the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier2” status, and would have created a complex and burdensome scheme for licensing approvals.\nIn May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of theforthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could\nhave a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long term, if thereare further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers\npurchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended serviceobligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or den"}

Even if theUSG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose\nnot to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical supportefforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in\nChina, Europe, and Israel.\nIn August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, but to date, we have notgenerated any revenue or shipped any H20 products under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the\nrevenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. Any request for a percentage of therevenue by the USG may subject us to litigation, increase our costs, and harm our competitive position and benefit competitors that are not subject to such\narrangements.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any timeand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the\nevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensingrequirements.\nFor example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for exampleby imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip trackingand throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. Such\ngovernment mandates in chip designs could introduce system vulnerabilities and expose us to significant risk and potential liability, negatively impact demand forour products, and could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Even if not enacted into binding legislation, draft billshave impacted and may in the future negatively impact our business. For example, following U.S. legislative proposals calling for mandatory features in our\nchips, China’s government publicly questioned whether our H20 products have built-in vulnerabilities, discouraging customers from purchasing our products. Weprovided a public response explaining that our GPUs, including H20, do not include such built-in vulnerabilities, and will respond to any follow-up questions we\nreceive.\nOpen-source foundation models are rapidly growing in popularity with developers worldwide. Any regulatory control or other restriction that limits our ability toprovide products and services that support third-party applications and models,\n36\nincluding applications built on foundation models originating in China such as DeepSeek or Qwen, could have a material impact on our business, operating\nresults, and financial condition.\nThe USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, itmay disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S.\nand Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete inmarkets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehousedin and distributed from Hong Kong.\nExport controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing ourGPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream\nparties to create large clusters for frontier model training.\nAny new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain ofour competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.

Export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China\nand other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that theyare able to serve markets worldwide. Export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our\ncustomers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results.\nAs a result, export controls have in the past and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in othermarkets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because\nby the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale, resulting in excess inventory and purchaseobligations as we recently experienced with the H20. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely\nto be restricted by U.S. controls.\nThe increasingly complex export controls impose complex and burdensome compliance obligations on our partners, suppliers, and customers. While we seek tostrictly comply with all applicable export control regulators, reports of diversion of controlled products may negatively impact our business, relationships with\npartners and customers, and our reputation. Incorrect allegations that our compliance efforts satisfy the letter but not the “spirit” of the applicable regulations maynegatively impact our business, relationships with partners and customers, and our reputation.\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured inwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG adopted “Connected Vehicle” restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the UnitedStates, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. The USG is also\nconsidering restrictions that would limit our ability to support third-party applications and models built on open-source foundation models originating in China.Such restrictions, if implemented, would favor our foreign competitors and negatively impact our business.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming\nrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government has and may continueto encourage customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products\ncontaining components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of productscontaining certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan thatendorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in\nChina. If the Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet thenew standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business,\noperating results and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financialresults.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new\nrestrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact ourbusiness and financial results.\nItem 2.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to\nyour death, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); provided, however, that:\n(i) such acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of\nyour estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if\napplicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under\napplicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of\nsuch acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement).\n(c)    On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the\nAccount that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant\nNotice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in\nor to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous Service during only a\nperiod prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata\nportion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date.\n    1.\n3.

Vesting.\n(a)    Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule\nprovided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice.\n(b)    Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in\nwhich case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the\nPlan). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to\nyour death, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); provided, however, that:\n(i) such acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of\nyour estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if\napplicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under\napplicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of\nsuch acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement).\n(c)    On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the\nAccount that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant\nNotice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in\nor to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock.

Amendment. Subject to Section 18 above, this Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated except by an instrument\nin writing, signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be\namended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such amendment is\ndelivered to you, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting your rights hereunder may be made without your written consent.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to you, the provisions of this Agreement in any way it may\ndeem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law,\nregulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such change will be applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is\nthen subject to restrictions as provided in this Agreement.\n23.    Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-\n1(b)(4) and thus to not be treated as “deferred compensation”, and will be construed and administered in such a manner, and any ambiguous or\nmissing terms that may otherwise be supplied from and/or defined under Code Section 409A in a manner that fulfills such intention hereby\nincorporated by reference.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined that the Award fails to satisfy the\nrequirements of the short-term deferral rule and is otherwise not exempt from, and determined to be deferred compensation subject to Code\nSection 409A, this Award shall comply with Code Section 409A to the extent necessary to avoid adverse personal tax consequences and any\nambiguities herein shall be interpreted accordingly. If it is determined that the Award is deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A and\nyou are a “specified employee” (as determined under Code Section 409A) on your “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury\nRegulation Section 1.409A-1(h), without regard to any\n    8.\nalternative definitions therein, a “Separation from Service”), then the issuance of any shares, cash or other property that would otherwise be\nmade on the date of your Separation from Service (or within the first six months thereafter as a result of your Separation from Service) will not be\nmade on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump sum on the earlier of (i) the date that is six months and one day\nafter the date of the Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death, but if and only if such delay in the issuance is necessary to avoid the\nimposition of taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or property under Code Section 409A.\n    9.\nEXHIBIT 31.1\nCERTIFICATION\nI, Jen-Hsun Huang, certify that:\n \n1.

KEY INFORMATION\nCapitalization and Indebtedness\nNot applicable.\nReasons for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\nRisk Factors\nWe wish to caution readers that the following important factors, and those important factors described in other reports submitted to, or filed with,\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“U.S. SEC”), among other factors, could affect our actual results and could cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, and that such factors may adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial status and therefore the value of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nAny global systemic political, economic and financial crisis (as well as the indirect effects flowing therefrom) could negatively affect our business,\nresults of operations, and financial condition.\nIn recent times, several major systemic political, economic and financial crises negatively affected global business, banking and financial sectors,\nincluding the semiconductor industry and markets.\nSince 2018, there have been political and trade tensions among a number of the world’s major economies. These tensions have resulted or may\nresult in the implementation of tariff, non-tariff trade barriers, sanctions, export controls and other measures that have been particularly impactful to the\nsemiconductor industry and related markets. Prolonged or increased use of such measures may negatively impact the growth of the global economy and\nthe semiconductor industry, resulting in declines in electronic products sales from which we generate our income through our products and services. For\nexample, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on April 2, 2025 a 10% baseline tariff on imports into the United States from all countries, as well as\nvarying reciprocal tariffs on certain trading partners, including Taiwan. The varying reciprocal tariffs, except those on Chinese goods, were then paused\nuntil July 9, 2025; imports subject to variable reciprocal tariffs will instead be subject to the baseline 10% tariff during the period. Semiconductors were\nnot subject to the reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2, 2025. However, given ongoing discussions between the United States and its trading partners,\nthere remains significant uncertainty about whether the United States may further change the scope and level of tariffs it imposes, including any\npotential tariffs it may impose on semiconductor imports. Any tariffs imposed on imports of semiconductors and products incorporating chips into the\nUnited States may result in increased costs for purchasing such products, which may, in turn, lead to decreased demand for our products and services\nand adversely affect our business and future growth. Also, any increase in the use of export control restrictions and sanctions to target certain countries\nand entities, any expansion of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of such measures, or complete or partial ban on semiconductor products sales to certain\nentities could impact not only our ability to continue supplying products to those customers, but also our customers’ demand for our products, and could\neven lead to changes in semiconductor supply chains. For example, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd.\nand its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”) in 2020.

For example, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd.\nand its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”) in 2020. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of products to Huawei\nsince September 2020. In October 2022 and October 2023, the U.S. adopted additional export controls (the “October Rules”) over specified countries\n(including China) under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“U.S. EAR”) on certain advanced computing integrated circuits (“ICs”), computer\ncommodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for\nsupercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end-uses. The controls impose license requirements for items subject to the U.S. EAR where the items\nare destined to a semiconductor fabrication facility in China that fabricates ICs meeting specified advanced node parameters as well as for U.S. persons’\nactivities supporting such facility or semiconductor manufacturing items. In response, we obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce a Validated\nEnd-User (the “VEU”) authorization for our fab located in Nanjing, China, which is a permanent authorization that allows our fab in Nanjing to receive\nexports of eligible items from the U.S. without separate licenses. However, there is no assurance that the VEU authorization we obtained will not be\nterminated in the future. The restrictions imposed by the October Rules on exports of advanced computing ICs are further reinforced by the U.S.’ new\nrules issued in January 2025. Under the new rules, we may need to obtain an export license prior to shipping products using 16-nanometer or below\nprocess to any global destination unless specific conditions are met. As a result, shipments of certain products may be delayed or prohibited due to the\nlicense requirements and our financial results may be adversely affected.\n/nobreakspace\n3\nOn the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract the impact of another country’s actions or regulations could lead to\nsignificant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among\nother matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational’s compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies. As of the date of\nthis annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected by the expanded export control regulations or the novel rules or\nmeasures adopted to counteract them. Nevertheless, depending on future developments in global trade tensions and military conflicts, such regulations,\nrules, or measures may have an adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a\nresult. Please see “Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations material to our operations, such as export control, environmental and\nclimate related laws and regulations, or the inability to timely obtain requisite approvals necessary for the conduct of our business, such as fab land and\nconstruction approvals, could harm our business and operational results or subject us to potential significant legal liability” for a further discussion.\nAny future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate\nfluctuations, inflation or deflation or changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies, could cause revenue or profits for the\nsemiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically. If the economic conditions or financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate, the\ndemand for our products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce our operating\nincome and net income. In addition, sufficient external financing may not be available to us on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to us,\nor at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when we need such financing to meet our capital requirements, we may be forced to curtail our\nexpansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until we obtain such financing. In conclusion, any of these events,\nincluding any future global systemic crisis or further escalation of trade tensions as described above, could materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations.\nOur global manufacturing, design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with political, economic, financial, military or other conditions\nor developments in various jurisdictions, including in particular the R.O.C., as well as in international trade, which could negatively affect our\nbusiness and financial status and therefore the market value of your investment.\nThe majority of our principal executive officers and our principal production facili"}

In addition, we have operations worldwide and a significant percentage of our revenue comes from\nsales to locations outside the R.O.C. Operating in the R.O.C. and overseas exposes us to changes in laws, rules, regulations and the enforcements of such\nlaws, rules and regulations in certain key areas that could have a material impact on our operations, such as intellectual property, labor, antitrust, export\ncontrol, import restrictions, and trade barriers or disputes. In addition, deterioration in general political, economic, financial or social conditions, military\nconflicts, the risk of outbreak of war or hostilities, terrorism events, security risks, social unrest, health conditions and possible disruptions in\ntransportation networks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate or elsewhere, could have an adverse impact on our business and results of\noperations as well as the market price and the liquidity of our ADSs and common shares. Furthermore, any major change in economic, fiscal and/or\ntrade policies in the U.S. from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue or in another major jurisdiction could severely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For example, recent political and trade tensions among major economies as well as military conflicts (such\nas the conflict in Ukraine since early 2022) have resulted in the imposition of trade barriers, such as sanctions and import and export controls, which\ncould increase our manufacturing costs, limit our access to certain supplies, make our pricing less competitive, and limit our ability to offer our products\nand services in some markets or source key materials and key production equipment, which may have adverse direct or indirect effects on our sales.\nAny law or government policy that encourages our customers to relocate their manufacturing capacity or supply chain to their own countries or\nrequire their respective contractors, subcontractors and relevant agents to do so could also impair our ability to sustain our current level of productivity\nand manufacturing efficiency. An important aspect of our business operation is an ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and\nsuppliers in the R.O.C. that provides us with significant operational synergies, flexibility and efficiencies. For example, we are able to temporarily\nreassign thousands of our engineers and other relevant personnel from one manufacturing site to another to refine specific designs and adapt\nmanufacturing processes in a timely manner. These advantages permit us to operate our manufacturing fabs efficiently and resolve any technical or\ncommercial difficulties quickly to maintain our competitive edge. Restrictions on our ability to transfer people among our operations in the R.O.C., the\nUnited States, the P.R.C., Japan, and Europe efficiently due to challenges such as regional employment rules and regulations, and immigration or travel\nrestrictions, may impair or reduce these advantages, and we may not be able to sustain our current ability to supply our customers with goods and\nservices at the current level of cost, quality, quantity and delivery schedule to which our customers have been accustomed.\n/nobreakspace\n4\nIn addition, the financial markets have viewed certain past developments in relations between the R.O.C. and the P.R.C. as occasions to depress\ngeneral market prices of the securities of R.O.C. companies, including our own.

Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand\nfor overall global semiconductor foundry services, including our products and services, could adversely affect our revenue. Further, semiconductor\nmanufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost assets once they are in operation. Because we own most of\nour manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or our\ncapacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease our margins. Conversely, as\nproduct demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve our margins. In addition, the\nhistorical trend of declining average selling prices (“ASP”) of end-use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go\ninto such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end-use applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by us, which, in turn, may\nnegatively impact our revenue, margin and earnings.\n/nobreakspace\n5\nSince we are dependent on the highly cyclical semiconductor and electronics industries, which have experienced significant and sometimes\nprolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity, our revenue, margins and earnings may fluctuate significantly.\nThe electronics industries and semiconductor market are cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid fluctuations in product demand, which\ncould impact our semiconductor foundry business.

Variations in customer order levels may result in volatility in our revenue and earnings. From time to\ntime, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity.\nBecause we are, and will continue to be, dependent on the demand of electronics and semiconductor companies for our services, periods of downturns\nand overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services,\nincluding our services. If we are not able to take appropriate actions, such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, our revenue,\nmargins and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity.\nIf we are unable to remain a technological leader in the semiconductor industry, unable to timely respond to fast-changing semiconductor market\ndynamics, or unable to maintain our edge in product quality, we may become less competitive.\nThe semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. We compete by developing process technologies using increasingly\nadvanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. We also compete by developing new derivative technologies. If we do not anticipate\nthese changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or our competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional\ntechnologies, we may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. For example, the global surge in the development of AI has had a\nsignificant impact on customer demand for advanced semiconductor chips and the market dynamics in our industry; thus, our ability to continuously\ndevelop relevant technologies, products and services to meet these customer needs and changes in the AI industry will be critical for us to effectively\ncompete in this space. We also believe that the effective use of AI in our internal operations is important to our long-term success. As the AI\ntechnologies are rapidly evolving, if we are unable to deploy new AI technologies in our internal operations as effectively as our competitors, it may hurt\nour competitive position. In addition, our customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the\nmarket. If we are unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, we risk losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the\nshift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all\nfurther discussed among these risk factors). Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving\nexpected product quality and product yield. If we fail to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business\nor customer trust. If we are unable to overcome the above factors, we may become less competitive and our revenue may decline significantly.\nIn light of the rise of new foundry service providers worldwide, if we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive foundry segment of\nthe semiconductor industry, including through equal access to governmental financial incentives, especially those available to our competitors, we\nmay lose customers and/or our profit margin and earnings may decrease.\nThe competition in the semiconductor foundry segment is fierce. We compete with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of\nintegrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced or different technologies than us. Other companies may\nhave greater financial and other resources than us, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds,\nor other incentives that may be unavailable to us. The governments of the United States, China, Europe, South Korea and Japan provide various\nincentive programs to promote developments of their domestic semiconductor industries, such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce\nSemiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (the “U.S. CHIPS Act”), which provides financial incentives to incentivize the development of U.S.\nsemiconductor industry. In November 2024, TSMC Arizona Corporation (“TSMC Arizona”) entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of\nCommerce for the receipt of certain incentives pursuant to the U.S. CHIPS Act, which includes up to US$6.6 billion in total direct funding and up to\nUS$5 billion of proposed loans.

Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where we are currently expanding or\nplanning to expand our production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to us, there is no assurance that we\nwill be able to receive such financial incentives, including pursuant to the U.S. CHIPS Act, at the levels we anticipate or at all. Additionally, any\nfinancial incentives we receive may be subject to conditions and requirements imposed by the grantors, such as restrictions on the expansion of facilities\nin foreign countries of concern and on joint research and technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern on any technology or product that\nraises national security concerns. Noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the grants that we may receive could result in a delay or forfeiture of\nall or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as obligate us to repay all or a portion of amounts already received pursuant to the grants.\nEven if we satisfy the conditions and requirements for the funding disbursement, it is possible that the grantor may delay the disbursement or be unable\nto provide the funding. While we expect to continue benefiting from government incentives, failure to obtain grants that we seek, to fully utilize\navailable grants, or to comply with the terms and conditions of grants could impact our ability to achieve our goals for the projects that would otherwise\nbenefit from grant funding and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n/nobreakspace\n6\nMoreover, our competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. Our\ncompetitors may also compete for our customers who seek to diversify their supply chains. These competitive activities may decrease our customer\nbase, our pricing, or both. If we are unable to compete effectively with such competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality, supply\nchain diversification and resilience, and customer satisfaction, we risk losing customers or business to such contenders.\nIf we are unable to manage our capacity and production facilities effectively, our competitiveness may be weakened.\nWe perform long-term market demand forecasts on a regular basis for our products and services to manage our overall capacity. Based on market\ndemand, we have continued to add capacity to meet market needs for our products and services, including in Taiwan, in Arizona, U.S., in Kumamoto,\nJapan and in Dresden, Germany.\nImplementing these capacity expansion plans will increase our costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, we would need to build\nnew facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If we do not increase our net revenue\naccordingly, our financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs. See “Item 4. Information on The Company – Capacity\nManagement and Technology Upgrade Plans” for a further discussion.\nIn addition, market conditions are dynamic, and our market demand forecasts may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased\ndemand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of our manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand\nsubsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, we may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn.\nIn such circumstances, our financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.\nHaving one or more large customers that account for a significant percentage of our revenue may render us vulnerable to the loss of or significant\ncurtailment of purchases by such customers that could in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, the increasing consolidation of\nour customers may further increase our revenue concentration.\nOver the years, our customer profile and the nature of our customers’ business have changed dramatically. While we generate revenue from\nhundreds of customers worldwide, our ten largest customers in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for approximately, 68%, 70% and 76% of our net\nrevenue in the respective year.

This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile and\nHPC devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.\nThere are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, we have seen changes in\nthe nature of our customers’ business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend among system\ncompanies designing their own semiconductors and working directly with the semiconductor foundries, which makes their products and services more\nmarketable in a changing consumer market. These shifting business models could lead to significant variations in our sales if the growth of their\nproducts and services, particularly in the AI sector, is volatile or not sustainable.\nAlso, since the global semiconductor industry has become increasingly competitive, some of our customers have engaged in industry\nconsolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of our major customers\nconsolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of our customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export controls directed at\nour major customers, could impact our ability to supply products to those customers or reduce those customers’ demand for our products and services\nand thus impact their business operations.\n/nobreakspace\n7\nThe loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to increased competitive\npressures, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or\npractices of these customers, the timing of customer inventory adjustments, or changes in our major customers’ business models, may adversely affect\nour results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our information technology systems or those of our service providers with whom we share our confidential information succumb to cyberattacks\nby third parties worldwide, our business and operations may be severely interrupted or even shut down, and our results of operations, financial\ncondition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.\nEven though we have established a comprehensive internet and computing security network, we cannot guarantee that our computing systems\nwhich control or maintain vital corporate functions, such as our manufacturing operations and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune to\ncrippling cyberattacks. In the event of a serious cyberattack, our systems may lose important corporate data or our production lines may be shut down\npending the resolution of such attack. Major cyberattacks could also lead to loss or divulgence of trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as\nproprietary information of our customers and other stakeholders and personal information of our employees. While we seek to continuously review and\nassess our cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, we cannot guarantee that we will not be susceptible to new\nand emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. For example, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could also use\nAI to develop malicious codes and sophisticated phishing attempts.\nMalicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into our network systems to disrupt our\noperations, blackmail us to regain control of our computing systems, or spy on us for sensitive information. These attacks may result in us having to pay\ndamages for our delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expenses in implementing remedial and improvement measures to further enhance our\ncybersecurity network, and may also expose us to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations\nassociated with such breaches.\nIn the past, we experienced and may in the future be subject to attack by malicious software.

Since there is fierce\ncompetition for talent recruitment, we cannot ensure timely fulfillment of our personnel demand.\nWe may be unable to obtain in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost equipment that is necessary for us to remain competitive.\nOur operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on our ability to obtain necessary equipment and related services available from a limited\nnumber of suppliers. As a result, we may encounter the situation of limited supply and/or long delivery cycles. To better manage our supply chain, we\nevaluate and project delivery lead times to minimize the impact of supply chain risks on operating costs. We have also implemented various\ncollaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead time. To enhance\nour sourcing capabilities for our global sites, we have also taken steps to strengthen our understanding of local regulations, policies, and supply chains.\nHowever, if we are unable to acquire in a timely manner the equipment and parts we need, we may fail to successfully implement capacity expansion\nplans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability\nof, key equipment, through delay or denial of necessary export licenses, adoption of additional export control measures and other tariff or non-tariff\nbarriers. If we are unable to obtain equipment in a timely fashion to fulfill our customers’ demand for technology and production capacity, or unable to\ndo so at a reasonable cost, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n/nobreakspace\n8\nOur revenue and profitability may decline if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner and at commercially\nreasonable prices.\nOur production operations require that we obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on\na timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific suppliers or by the\nsemiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters,\ntrade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation, occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials\nmay also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since we procure some of our raw materials from sole-\nsourced suppliers, there is a risk that our need for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available.

Our revenue and earnings could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a\ntimely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials.\nAny inability to obtain, preserve, enforce, defend and protect our technologies, intellectual property rights and third-party licenses could harm our\ncompetitive position.\nOur ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio.\nWhile we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the\nmisappropriation or improper use of our proprietary technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, we cannot assure you that, as our business\nor business models expand into new areas, we will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how\nnecessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, we may\nhave to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that we rely on licenses from others, there can be\nno assurance that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms we consider reasonable or at all. The lack of\nnecessary licenses could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in\ninstances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.\nWe have received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies,\nasserting that our technologies, our manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by us or the use of those semiconductors by\nour customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, our market position, and the\nexpansion of our manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, we may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The\nassertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in\nseeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase our cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if\nthese asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by us. See “Item 8. Financial Information – Legal\nProceedings” for a further discussion. Also, with the expansion of our manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C jurisdictions, we have faced\nincreased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of\nintellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to\nprevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fail to prevent our intellectual property from being\nmisappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (i) prevent us from manufacturing particular products\nor selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (ii) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our\nmisappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce our opportunities to generate revenue.\n/nobreakspace\n9\nOur operational results could also be materially and adversely affected by disruptive events or industrial accidents, in the locations in which we, our\ncustomers or our suppliers operate.\nDisruptions caused by natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires,\nvolcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage or spill, pandemic, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tensions, sabotage, terrorism, failure\nof critical facilities and equipment, disruptions in utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc., could interrupt our operations. Most of our\nproduction facilities, as well as those of many of our suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing\nservices, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity and/or water, which could cause interruptions\nto our operations. In April 2024 and January 2025, several earthquakes struck Taiwan, causing damage to our inventories, plant facilities, machinery and\nequipment. We recognized approximately NT$3 billion and NT$5.3 billion in losses from earthquakes, net of insurance claim, respectively, in the\nsecond quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025.\nIf one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to our operations or those of our customers or suppliers,"}

Some of these incidents have resulted in interruptions to our operations. Such outages, shortages or interruptions in\nelectricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If we are unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted\nsupply of electricity for our manufacturing fabs, our ability to fill customers’ orders would be jeopardized. Moreover, we have encountered and may\ncontinue to encounter increases in the prices of utilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, we became subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in\nTaiwan, which increased by 25% as compared to the tariff rate applicable to us in 2023. In October 2024, the electricity tariff rate further increased by\n14%. The hike in electricity prices could increase our manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, due to climate change, severe weather events, such as droughts, and any measures taken by governments in response to such severe\nweather events may materially affect our operations and our suppliers’ production. For example, the measures taken by governments in response to\ndroughts, including water rationing and conservation, may cause interruption to our operations or our expansion plans.\nIf such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, our operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse fluctuations in exchange rates could decrease our operating margin and/or revenue.\nSubstantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of our capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the\nNT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT\ndollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on our revenue and\noperating profit as expressed in NT dollars. For example, every 1% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an\napproximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in our operating margin based on our 2024 results.\nConversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of our customers\nand for our goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect our revenue. Please see “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk” for a further discussion.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations material to our operations, such as export control, environmental and climate related\nlaws and regulations, or the inability to timely obtain requisite approvals necessary for the conduct of our business, such as fab land and\nconstruction approvals, could harm our business and operational results or subject us to potential significant legal liability.\nBecause we engage in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conduct business with our customers located worldwide, such\nactivities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of our products require the use of\nequipment that is subject to export control laws and regulations, as well as metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-\nrelated, health and safety, and humanitarian forced labor prohibition and conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide.

This constraint impedes our ability to fully ensure that semiconductors manufactured\nby us will not be diverted to unintended end use or end-user, including potentially by our business partners, or by third parties with an intent of\ncircumvention. In addition, if we or our business partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits or are found to have\nviolated applicable export control or sanctions laws, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative\nconsequences, including government investigations and penalties resulting from relevant legal proceedings, as described in the above paragraph. In\nOctober 2024, we notified relevant U.S. and Taiwan authorities that one type of our customer’s chip manufactured by us might have been diverted to a\nrestricted entity or incorporated into a restricted entity’s product, and since then have been cooperating with the authorities’ requests for additional\ninformation and documents. Despite our best efforts to comply with all relevant export control and sanctions laws and regulations, there is no assurance\nthat our business activities will not be found incompliant with export control laws and regulations.\nComplying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require us, among\nother things, to do the following: (a) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (b) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation\nprograms and air pollution reduction plans; (c) modify our product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as\npaying any incurred carbon fees if our emission levels exceed applicable thresholds, and obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy\ncertificates or carbon credits, substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for our operations.\nOur inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of our business could impair our operational and financial results. For example,\nif we are unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion\nproject, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of our expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect our business and\noperational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, our operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or\ndelayed in response to public concern and social environmental pressures even if we comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\nFor further details, please see our compliance record with Taiwan and international environmental and climate related laws and regulations as well\nas our business continuity management of climate change policy in “Item 4.

If certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge. We are\nnot able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect\non our net income.\nThe determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent\nto that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when our operating results are otherwise already depressed. See\n“Item 5. Operating and Financial Reviews and Prospects – Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty” for\na discussion of how we assess if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.\nAny failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent\nfraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and corruption, our reputation and\nresults of operations could be harmed.\nWe are required to comply with various R.O.C. and U.S. laws and regulations on internal controls, but internal controls may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements because of their inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, fraud or\ncorruption.\nTherefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial\nstatements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our\nreporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and ADSs.\nAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the R.O.C., the United States or other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate our business may have an adverse effect on our net income.\nWhile we are subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct business, our principal operations are in\nthe R.O.C. and we are exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. Any unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in these\njurisdictions could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our operating results. Further, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions\ncould arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project that was undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (“OECD”). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on our operating results. See “Item 5.

Although we may be eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions for rights offerings by\ncertain foreign companies, we can give no assurance that we can establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and we are under no\nobligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have such a registration statement\ndeclared effective. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a\nresult.\nIf the depositary bank is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably practicable, it will\nallow the rights to lapse, in which case you will receive no value for these rights.\nThe value of your investment may be reduced by possible future sales of common shares or ADSs by us or our shareholders or fluctuations in\nforeign exchange.\nOne or more of our existing shareholders may, from time to time, dispose of significant numbers of our common shares or ADSs. For example, the\nNational Development Fund of the R.O.C., which owned 6.38% of TSMC’s outstanding shares as of February 28, 2025, had from time to time in the\npast sold our shares in the form of ADSs in several transactions.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of ADSs or common shares, or the availability of ADSs or common shares for future sales,\nwill have on the market price of ADSs or common shares prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of ADSs or common shares in the\npublic market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the prevailing market price of our ADSs or common shares. In addition,\nfluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of our common shares and the market price\nof the ADSs and the U.S. dollar value of any cash dividends paid in NT dollars on our common shares represented by ADSs.\nThe market value of our shares may fluctuate due to the volatility of, and government intervention in, the R.O.C. securities market.\nThe Taiwan Stock Exchange has experienced from time to time substantial fluctuations in the prices and volumes of sales of listed securities.\nThere are currently limits on the range of daily price movements on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In response to past declines and volatility in the\nsecurities markets in Taiwan, and in line with similar activities by other countries in Asia, the government of the R.O.C. formed the Stabilization Fund,\nwhich had purchased and may from time to time purchase shares of Taiwan companies to support these markets. In addition, other funds associated with\nthe R.O.C. government had in the past purchased, and may from time to time purchase, shares of Taiwan companies on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or\nother markets.

This increase was primarily from the expansion of our 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer advanced technologies.\nCapacity Management and Technology Upgrade Plans\nWe manage our overall capacity and technology upgrade plans based on long term market demand forecasts for our products and services.\nAccording to our current market demand forecasts, we intend to maintain the strategy of expanding manufacturing capacity and upgrading\nmanufacturing technologies to meet both the fabrication and the technology needs of our customers.\nOur capital expenditures in 2022, 2023 and 2024 were NT$1,082,672 million, NT$949,817 million and NT$956,007 million (US$29,755 million,\ntranslated from a weighted average exchange rate of NT$32.13 to US$1.00), respectively. Our capital expenditures in 2025 are expected to be between\nUS$38 billion and US$42 billion, which, depending on market conditions, may be adjusted later. Our capital expenditures for 2022, 2023 and 2024 were\nfunded by our operating cash flow and proceeds from the issuance of corporate bonds, and our capital expenditures for 2025 are also expected to be\nfunded in the same way. In 2025, we anticipate our capital expenditures to focus primarily on the following:\n/nobreakspace\n •  installing and expanding capacity, mainly for 2-nanometer, 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer nodes, including building/facility exp ansion for\nFab 20, Fab 21 and Fab 22;\n/nobreakspace\n •  expanding capacity for specialty technologies and advanced packaging, including building/facility expansion for Fab 23 and F ab 24; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  investing in research and development projects for new process technologies.\nWe are entering a period of higher growth as the multiyear megatrends of 5G and high performance computing are expected to fuel strong demand\nfor our semiconductor technologies in the next several years.

The decrease\nwas partially offset by an increase in orders from China of NT$21,985 million, or a 9% year-over-year increase.\nWe provide worldwide customer support. Our office in Hsinchu and subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Japan, China, Germany, the\nNetherlands and South Korea are dedicated to serving our customers worldwide. Foundry services, which are both technologically and logistically\nintensive, involve frequent and in-depth interaction with customers. We believe that the most effective means of providing foundry services is by\ndeveloping direct and close relationships with our customers. Our customer service and technical support managers work closely with the sales force to\noffer integrated services to customers. To facilitate customer interaction and information access on a real-time basis, a suite of web-based applications\nhave also been offered to provide more active interactions with customers in design, engineering and logistics.\nAdvance Payment by Customers. Because of the fast-changing technology and functionality in semiconductor design, foundry customers\ngenerally do not place purchase orders far in advance to manufacture a particular type of product. However, some of our customers have entered into\nagreements with us to pay temporary receipts in order to retain specified capacity at our fabs. The treatment of advance temporary receipts, either by\nrefund or by accounts receivable offsetting, will be determined by mutual consent when the terms and conditions set forth in the agreements are\nsatisfied. See note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nThe Semiconductor Fabrication Process\nIn general, the semiconductor manufacturing process begins with a thin silicon wafer on which an array of semiconductor devices is fabricated.\nThe following processes cover assembly, packaging, and testing of the semiconductor devices. Our focus is on wafer fabrication although we also\nprovide other services either directly or through outsourcing arrangements.\nOur Foundry Services\nRange of Services. Because of our ability to provide a full array of services, we are able to accommodate customers with a variety of needs at\nevery stage of the overall foundry process. The flexibility in input stages allows us to cater to a variety of customers with different in-house capabilities\nand thus to service a wider class of customers as compared to a foundry that cannot offer design or mask making services, for example. As we serve a\nlarge global customer base that entails a wide range of applications, such customer diversification helps to smooth fluctuations in demand.\nFabrication Processes.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase from Automotive of NT$17,273 million, or a 15% year-over-year increase.\nDesign and Technology Platforms. Modern integrated circuit designers need sophisticated design infrastructure to optimize productivity and\ncycle time. Such infrastructure includes design flow for electronic design automation (“EDA”), silicon proven building blocks such as libraries and\nintellectual properties, simulation and verification design kits such as PDK and technology files. All of this infrastructure is built on top of the\ntechnology foundation, and each technology needs its own design infrastructure to be usable for designers. This is the concept of our technology\nplatforms.\nFor years, we and our alliance partners have spent considerable effort, time and resources to build our technology platforms. We unveiled an Open\nInnovation Platform® (“OIP”) initiative in 2008 to further enhance our technologies offerings. More OIP deliverables were introduced over the years, as\nwell as in 2024. In the design methodology area, we announced EDA and intellectual property readiness of 2-nanometer and 3-nanometer, as well as\ncontinuous development of solutions to enhance power, performance and area (“PPA”) on existing production technology nodes. In addition, we also\nannounced the openness of 3Dblox Standard to the semiconductor industry, as well as the availability of various 3-Dimensional Integrated Circuit\n(“3DIC”) reference flows to support TSMC 3DFabric® technologies in 3D silicon stacking and advanced packaging which cover a wide range of\nsystem-level design applications.\n/nobreakspace\n18\nMulti-project Wafer Program (“CyberShuttle®”). To help our customers reduce costs, we offer a dedicated multi-project wafer processing service\nthat allows us to provide multiple customers with circuits produced with the same mask. This program reduces mask costs by a very significant amount,\nresulting in accelerated time-to-market for our customers. We have extended this program to all of our customers and library and intellectual property\npartners using our broad selection of process technologies, ranging from the latest 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 12-, 16-, 22-, 28-, 40-, 45-, 55-, 65- and 90-\nnanometer processes to 0.13-, 0.18-, 0.25-, 0.35- and 0.5-micron. This extension offers a routinely scheduled multi-project wafer run to customers on a\nshared-cost basis for prototyping and verification.\nWe developed our multi-project wafer program in response to the current SoC development methodologies, which often require the independent\ndevelopment, prototyping and validation of several intellectual properties before they can be integrated onto a single device. By sharing mask costs\namong our customers to the extent permissible, the SoC supplier can enjoy reduced prototyping costs and greater confidence that the design will be\nsuccessful.\nCustomer Service\nWe believe that our dedication to customer service has been an indispensable factor in attracting new customers, helping to ensure the satisfaction\nof existing customers, and building a mutually beneficial relationship with our customers. The key elements are our:\n/nobreakspace\n •  customer-oriented culture through multi-level interaction with customers;\n/nobreakspace\n •  ability to deliver products of consistent quality, competitive ramp-up speed and fast yield improvement;\n/nobreakspace\n •  responsiveness to customers’ issues and requirements, such as engineering change and special wafer handling requests;\n/nobreakspace\n •  flexibility in manufacturing processes, supported by our competitive technical capability and production planning;\n/nobreakspace\n •  dedication to help reduce customer costs through collaboration and services, such as our multi-project wafer program, which c ombines\nmultiple designs on a single mask set for cost-saving; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  availability of our online service which provides necessary information in design, engineering and logistics to ensure seamle ss services to\nour customers throughout the product life cycle.\nWe also conduct an annual customer satisfaction survey to assess customer satisfaction and to ensure that their needs are adequately understood\nand addressed.

We believe that to remain technologically ahead of our\ncompetitors and maintain our market position in the foundry segment, we need to be a technology leader in the semiconductor industry. In 2022, 2023,\nand 2024, we spent NT$163,262 million, NT$182,370 million, and NT$204,182 million (US$6,227 million), respectively, on research and development,\nrepresenting 7.2%, 8.5% and 7.1% of our net revenue, respectively. We plan to continue significant investment in research and development in 2025 to\nmaintain our leadership in advanced process technologies. Our research and development efforts have enabled us to offer customers access to advanced\nprocess technologies, such as 7-, 5- and 3-nanometer technology for volume production, prior to the implementation of those advanced process\ntechnologies by competitors and many integrated device manufacturers. We expect to further advance our process technologies to 2-nanometer and\nbelow in the coming years to sustain our technology leadership. We will also invest in research and development for our mature technology offerings to\nprovide function-rich process capabilities to our customers. Our research and development activities are divided into centralized and fab-conducted\nresearch and development activities. Centralized research and development activities focus on developing new logic, SoC, derivatives,\npackage/system-in-package (“SIP”) technologies, along with cost-effective 3D wafer level system integration solutions, including InFO, CoWoS®, and\nTSMC-SoIC® technologies. Fab-conducted research and development activities focus on improving and upgrading the manufacturing process\ntechnologies.\n/nobreakspace\n19\nTo advance our process technologies, we rely primarily on our internal engineering capabilities, know-how and research and development efforts,\nincluding collaboration with our customers, equipment vendors and external research and development consortia.\nWe continually create inventions and in-house know-how. Since our inception, we have applied for and been issued a substantial number of\npatents in the United States and other countries, the majority of which are semiconductor related.\nCompetition\nWe compete internationally and domestically with other foundry service providers, as well as with a number of integrated device manufacturers.\nWe compete primarily on process technologies, manufacturing excellence, customer trust and service quality, such as earlier technology readiness, better\nquality, faster yield improvement and shorter cycle time. The level of competition varies with the process technologies involved. For example, in more\nmature technologies, competitors tend to be numerous and offer specialized processes. Some companies compete with us in selected geographic regions\nor niche application markets. In recent years, substantial investments have been made by others to establish new foundry capacities worldwide, or to\ntransform certain manufacturing operations of integrated device manufacturers into foundry capacities.\nEquipment\nThe quality and technology of the equipment used in the semiconductor manufacturing process are important in that they effectively define the\nlimits of our process technologies. Advances in process technologies cannot be brought about without commensurate advances in equipment technology.\nWe have periodic meetings with suppliers with respect to co-developing next-generation equipment.\nThe principal pieces of equipment used by us to manufacture semiconductors are scanners, cleaners and track equipment, inspection equipment,\netchers, furnaces, wet stations, strippers, implanters, sputterers, chemical vapor deposition (“CVD”) equipment, chemical mechanism polish (“CMP”)\nequipment, testers and probers. Other than certain equipment under leases located at testing areas, we own all of the equipment used at our fabs.\nIn implementing our capacity management and technology advancement plans, we expect to make significant purchases of equipment required for\nsemiconductor manufacturing. Some of the equipment is available from a limited number of suppliers and/or is manufactured in relatively limited\nquantities, and certain equipment has only recently been developed. We believe that well management of the relationships with our equipment suppliers\nis important for us as a major purchaser of semiconductor fabrication equipment. We work closely with manufacturers that provide equipment\ncustomized to our needs for certain advanced technologies.\nRaw Materials\nOur manufacturing processes use many raw materials, primarily silicon wafers, chemicals, gases and various types of precious metals.

Although\nmost of our raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, some materials are purchased through sole-sourced suppliers. Our raw material\nprocurement policy is to select only those suppliers who have demonstrated quality control and reliability on delivery time and to maintain multiple\nsources for each raw material whenever possible so that a quality or delivery problem with any one supplier will not adversely affect our operations. The\nquality and delivery performance of each supplier is evaluated quarterly and quantity allocations are adjusted for subsequent periods based on the\nevaluation.\nThe most important raw material used in our production is silicon wafer, which is the basic raw material from which integrated circuits are made.\nIn pursuit of high quality raw wafers, the majority of our raw wafers are supplied by a limited number of suppliers located in Taiwan, Japan, Germany,\nand Singapore. We have in the past obtained, and believe we will continue to be able to obtain, a sufficient supply of wafers. In order to secure a reliable\nand flexible supply of high quality wafers, we have entered into long-term agreements and intend to continue to develop strategic relationships with\nmajor wafer suppliers to cover our anticipated wafer needs for future years. Also, we actively address supply chain issues and bring together fab\noperations, materials management, quality system and risk management teams to mitigate potential supply chain risks and enhance supply chain agility.\nThis taskforce works with our primary suppliers to review their business continuity plans, qualify their dual-plant materials, prepare safety inventories,\nimprove the quality of their products, and manage the supply chain risks of their suppliers.

Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks\nRelating to Our Business” for a discussion of the risk related to raw materials, including the fluctuation of prices of our main raw materials.\n/nobreakspace\n20\nEnvironmental and Climate Related Laws and Regulations\nThe semiconductor production process generates gaseous chemical wastes, greenhouse gases (“GHG”), liquid wastes, wastewater and other\nindustrial wastes in various stages of the manufacturing process. We have installed in our fabs various types of pollution control equipment for the\ntreatment of gaseous and liquid chemical wastes and wastewater, equipment for GHG emission reduction and equipment for the recycling of used\nchemicals and treated water. Operations at our fabs are subject to regulations and periodic monitoring by the R.O.C. Ministry of Environment, the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the State Environmental Protection Administration of China, the Japan Ministry of the Environment, the European\nEnvironment Agency and European Chemicals Agency, and local environmental protection authorities in Taiwan, the U.S., China, Japan and Germany.\nWe have adopted pollution control and GHG emission reduction measures to ensure compliance with environmental protection and climate related\nstandards consistent with the practice of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan, the U.S., China, Japan and Europe. We conduct environmental audits at\nleast once annually to ensure that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and climate related laws and regulations.\nAn environmental, safety and health (“ESH”) team operates at the corporate level that is responsible for policy establishment and enforcement,\ncoordination with ESH teams located at each manufacturing facility and for coordination and interaction with government agencies worldwide.\nTo fulfill our commitment to environmental sustainability in our business and operations, we have continued to explore and participate in\ninitiatives to expand our use of renewable energy. In 2024, TSMC used in total 3,610 GWh in renewable energy, renewable energy certificates, and\ncarbon credits globally, of which approximately 2,160 GWh enabled our overseas sites to be 100% powered by clean energy for the seventh consecutive\nyear.

We aim to become a leading company in environmental protection by incorporating green management into our\ndaily operations. Utilizing innovative technologies, we focus on critical areas such as climate and energy, water stewardship, circular resources, air\npollution control, and biodiversity conservation to advance sustainable development.\n/nobreakspace\n21\nBuild a responsible supply chain. We are committed to responsible purchasing, which drives us to collaborate closely with supply chain partners\non technology, quality, delivery, human rights, and environmental protection. In light of the pressing challenges posed by climate change, we plan to\nenhance green innovation and climate/nature resilience alongside our suppliers, fostering a low-carbon semiconductor supply chain.\nCreate a healthy and inclusive workplace. We are devoted to creating a safe, healthy, equitable and inclusive workplace that respects human\nrights while enabling employees to reach their full potential. We also provide competitive compensation and welfare, striving to be a company that\nemployees can rely on and take pride in.\nDevelop talent. We actively support our employee’s career development and are dedicated to inspiring the next generation of semiconductor\nindustry professionals. To accomplish this, we partner with middle and high schools, universities and research institutions to promote STEAM (science,\ntechnology, engineering, art, and mathematics) education and strengthen our efforts in semiconductor industry-academia collaboration.\nCare for the underprivileged. The TSMC Education and Culture Foundation and the TSMC Charity Foundation focus on addressing society’s\nevolving needs. The two foundations integrate and invest internal and external resources to empower young generation, support rural communities,\nprovide emergency relief, and promote art and cultural literacy.\nFor further information on our ESG initiatives, please refer to our annual Sustainability Reports, available on our ESG website at\nhttps://esg.tsmc.com/en-US/resources/ESG-data-hub. The information contained on our website is not incorporated herein by reference and does not\nconstitute part of this annual report.\nElectricity and Water\nWe have occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by our electricity supplier, or other power\nconsumers on the same power grid. Such power outages, dips or surges may lead to interruptions in our production schedule. The semiconductor\nmanufacturing process uses extensive amounts of electricity and water. Due to changes in the energy policy of the government, the growth of\nmanufacturers in the Hsinchu Science Park, Southern Taiwan Science Park and Central Taiwan Science Park, and the droughts that Taiwan experiences\nfrom time to time, there is concern regarding future availability of sufficient electricity and water for our production in Taiwan. To help address these\npotential shortages and avoid the potential impact that insufficient electricity and water supplies may have on our semiconductor production, we have\nadopted various natural resources conservation methodologies. Moreover, we have encountered and may continue to encounter increases in the prices of\nutilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, we became subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in Taiwan, which increased by 25% as compared\nto the tariff rate applicable to us in 2023. In October 2024, the electricity tariff rate further increased by 14%. The hike in electricity prices could\nincrease our manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact our financial results. Please see “Item 3. Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks\nRelating to Our Business” for a discussion of the risk related to shortages or increased prices in electricity and water.\nRisk Management\nWe employ a balanced risk-reward approach to risk management to optimize business returns. This applies to all aspects of the business, including\nour commitment to ESG issues in delivering long-term value to all stakeholders. Our risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors and\nsigned by the Chairman and CEO.

Our ERM framework specifies the risk governance structure, the management process that integrates business\noperations, and the tools that facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risks. A formalized training and communication program to build\nrisk competency and foster a risk-aware culture helps management make informed risk-based decisions while implementing corporate strategies. We are\ncommitted to maintaining operational resilience and business continuity by following standards that enable us to respond effectively to business\ndisruptions.\nTo mitigate the operational impact of crisis events, we implement pre-crisis risk assessments, response procedures and recovery plans. To enhance\noperational preparedness, we conduct exercises and drills to validate emergency responses, crisis management, and business continuity plans. In major\nincidents or crisis events, the crisis management guidelines are followed. The central crisis command center (“C4”), headed by the Chairman and CEO\nand comprised of senior executives across key functions, provides guidance and decision-making to maintain response readiness, including timely\ncommunication to key stakeholders.\nWe also maintain insurance with respect to our facilities, equipment and inventories. The insurance for the fabs and their equipment covers,\nsubject to some limitations, various risks, including earthquake, fire, typhoon and other risks generally up to the respective policy limit for their\nreplacement values and lost profits due to business interruption. In addition, we have insurance policies covering losses with respect to the construction\nof all our fabs. Equipment and inventories in transit are also insured. While we maintain insurance to cover certain types of losses, no assurance can be\ngiven that insurance will fully cover all the losses that may arise or that our emergency responses and business continuity plans will be effective in\npreventing or reducing losses.\nFor further information, please see detailed risk factors related to the impact of climate change regulations and international accords, and natural\ndisasters on our operations in “Item 3.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n/nobreakspace\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS AND PROSPECTS\nThe following discussion covers items for and a comparison between the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the discussion\ncovering items for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and a comparison between the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, please refer\nto “Item 5” of our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. SEC.\nOverview\nWe manufacture a variety of semiconductors based on designs provided by our customers. Our business model is commonly called a “dedicated\nsemiconductor foundry.” As a leader of the foundry segment, our net revenue and net income attributable to shareholders of the parent were\nNT$2,161,736 million and NT$851,740 million in 2023, and NT$2,894,308 million (US$88,268 million) and NT$1,158,380 million (US$35,327\nmillion) in 2024, respectively. Please see “ – Year-to-Year Comparisons – Net Revenue” for a discussion of the changes in net revenue from 2023 to\n2024.\nThe principal source of our revenue is wafer fabrication, which accounted for approximately 87% of our net revenue in 2024. The rest of our net\nrevenue was mainly derived from packaging and testing services, mask making, design, and royalty income. Factors that significantly impact our\nrevenue include:\n/nobreakspace\n •  worldwide demand and capacity supply for semiconductor products;\n/nobreakspace\n •  pricing;\n/nobreakspace\n •  production capacity;\n/nobreakspace\n •  technology development; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWhile the above factors are significant factors, four of which are elaborated as follows:\nPricing. We establish pricing levels for specific periods of time with our customers, some of which are subject to adjustment during the course of\nthat period to take into account market conditions and other factors. We believe that customers find value in our flexible manufacturing capabilities,\nfocus on customer service and timely delivery of high yield products, and this value is reflected in our pricing. Our pricing enables us to continue to\ninvest significantly in research and development to deliver ever-improving products to our customers, and sustain healthy financial conditions to expand\ncapacity and support customers’ growth.\nProduction Capacity. We currently own and operate our semiconductor manufacturing facilities. For the years of 2023 and 2024, our production\ncapacity was approximately 16 million and 17 million 12-inch equivalent wafers, respectively.\nTechnology Development. Our operation utilizes a variety of process technologies, ranging from mature process technologies of 0.25 micron or\nabove circuit resolutions to advanced process technologies of 3-nanometer circuit resolutions. The table below presents a breakdown of wafer revenue\nby circuit resolution during the periods indicated:\n/nobreakspace\n   Year ended December 31,\n   2022  2023  2024\nResolution   \n  Percentage of  \ntotal wafer\nrevenue(1)  \n  Percentage of  \ntotal wafer\nrevenue(1)  \n  Percentage of  \ntotal wafer\nrevenue(1)\n3-nanometer     —    6%   18%\n5-nanometer    26%   33%   34%\n7-nanometer    27%   19%   17%\n16-nanometer    13%   10%    8%\n20-nanometer     —    1%    0%\n28-nanometer    10%   10%    7%\n40/45-nanometer     7%    6%    4%\n65-nanometer     5%    6%    4%\n90-nanometer     2%    1%    1%\n0.11/0.13 micron     3%    2%    2%\n0.15/0.18 micron     6%    5%    4%\n≥0.25 micron     1%    1%    1%\nTotal   100%  100%  100%\n/nobreakspace\n(1) The figure represents wafer revenue from a certain technology as a percentage of the total wafer revenue.\n/nobreakspace\n25\nIn 2024, the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer revenues represented 18%, 34% and 17% of total wafer revenue, respectively.

Advanced\ntechnologies (7-nanometer and below) accounted for 69% of total wafer revenue, up from 58% in 2023.\nIn 2023, the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer revenues represented 6%, 33% and 19% of total wafer revenue, respectively. Advanced\ntechnologies (7-nanometer and below) accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 53% in 2022.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate. Substantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars while we publish our financial statements in NT\ndollars. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates of the NT dollar against the U.S. dollar would have a significant impact on our reported revenue. The\nNT dollar depreciation in 2024 had a favorable effect on our revenue, with weighted average exchange rates of the NT dollar per U.S. dollar\ndepreciating from NT$31.19 in 2023 to NT$32.13 in 2024.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\nSummarized below are our accounting policies that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial results and also involve the need for\nmanagement to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain in nature. Actual results may differ from these estimates, judgments and\nassumptions. Certain accounting policies are particularly critical because of their significance to our reported financial results and the possibility that\nfuture events may differ significantly from the conditions and assumptions underlying the estimates used and judgments made by us in preparing our\nfinancial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are\nincluded in this annual report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Judgments\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied when\ncustomers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to our customers’ specified locations.\nCommencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in\nProgress (“EUI” and “CIP”). Commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended\nuse. The criteria we use to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the\nconditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\nJudgments on Lease Terms. In determining a lease term, we consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or\nnot to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option.\nMain factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the\nlessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within our control occurs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\nEstimation of Sales Returns and Allowances. Sales returns and other allowances is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in\nconsideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. We periodically\nreview the reasonableness of the estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, actual returns and allowances could be different from\nour estimates. If the actual returns are greater than our estimated amount, we could be required to record an additional liability, which would have a\nnegative impact on our recorded revenue and gross margin. For further information, please refer to note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.\nInventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value for finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials,\nsupplies and spare parts. Inventory write-downs are made on an item-by-item basis, except where it may be appropriate to group similar or related items.\nA significant amount of our manufacturing costs is fixed because our extensive manufacturing facilities (which provide us large production\ncapacity) require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once they become operational. When the capacity utilization\nincreases, the fixed manufacturing costs are spread over a larger amount of output, which would lower the inventory cost per unit.\n/nobreakspace\n26\nWe evaluate our ending inventory based on standard cost under normal capacity utilization, and reduce the carrying value of our inventory when\nthe actual capacity utilization is"}

When the capacity utilization\nincreases, the fixed manufacturing costs are spread over a larger amount of output, which would lower the inventory cost per unit.\n/nobreakspace\n26\nWe evaluate our ending inventory based on standard cost under normal capacity utilization, and reduce the carrying value of our inventory when\nthe actual capacity utilization is higher than normal capacity utilization. No adjustment is made to the carrying value of inventory when the actual\ncapacity utilization is at or lower than normal capacity utilization. Normal capacity utilization is established based on historic loadings compared to total\navailable capacity in our wafer manufacturing fabs.\nWe also evaluate our ending inventory and reduce the carrying value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items by an\namount that is the difference between the cost of the inventory and the net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined\nmainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon, which is generally 180 days or less.\nImpairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-Use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill. We assess the impairment of tangible assets\n(property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the asset may be impaired and the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nIndicators we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:\n/nobreakspace\n •  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n/nobreakspace\n •  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  significant unfavorable industry or economic trends.\nWhen we determine that the carrying value of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill may not be recoverable\nbased upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment for tangible assets, right-of-use assets and\nintangible assets other than goodwill based on projected future cash flow. If the tangible assets, right-of-use assets or intangible assets other than\ngoodwill are determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the recoverable amount,\nmeasured at the present value of discounted cash flows attributable to the assets, is less than their carrying value. Such cash flow analysis includes\nassumptions about expected future economic and market conditions, the applicable discount rate, and the future revenue generation from the use or\ndisposition of the assets. We also perform a periodic review to identify assets that are no longer used and are not expected to be used in future periods\nand record an impairment charge to the extent that the carrying amount of the tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than\ngoodwill exceeds the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount subsequently increases, the impairment loss previously recognized will be reversed\nto the extent of the increase in the recoverable amount, provided that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would\nhave been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, we are\nrequired to review for impairment groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. We determine the independent cash\nflows that can be related to specific asset groups. In addition, we determine the remaining useful lives of assets and the expected future revenue and\nexpenses associated with the assets. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in\nsignificant impairment charges or reversal in future periods. Our projection for future cash flow is generally lower during periods of reduced earnings.\nAs a result, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when our operating results are already otherwise depressed. For further\ninformation, including impairment losses recognized in 2023 and 2024, please refer to note 15, note 16 and note 17 to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nRealization of Deferred Income Tax Assets. When we have temporary differences in the amount of tax expenses recorded for tax purposes and\nfinancial reporting purposes, we may be able to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in future periods. We generally\nrecognize deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future to utilize such assets. The\nincome tax benefit or expense is recorded when there is a net change in our total deferred tax assets and liabilities in a period. The ultimate realization of\nthe deferred tax assets depends upo"}

The\nincome tax benefit or expense is recorded when there is a net change in our total deferred tax assets and liabilities in a period. The ultimate realization of\nthe deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences may be utilized.\nSpecifically, the realization of deferred income tax assets is impacted by our expected future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, Alternative\nMinimum Tax (“AMT”), the surtax imposed on unappropriated earnings and the amount of tax credits that can be utilized within the statutory period. In\ndetermining the amount of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, we considered past performance, the general outlook of the semiconductor\nindustry, business conditions, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.\n/nobreakspace\n27\nBecause the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized is based, in part, on our forecast of future profitability, it is\ninherently uncertain and subjective.

The R.O.C. Controlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules enacted in 2016 have been implemented\nsince January 1, 2023, pursuant to which, certain profits retained at a CFC located in a low-tax jurisdiction would be taxable at its parent company in\nTaiwan. On the other hand, effective from January 1, 2023, the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation was amended such that eligible companies that\ndevelop innovative technologies domestically and possess leading position in global supply chain may claim investment tax credit of 25% on qualified\nR&D expenditure and 5% on procurement of machinery/equipment for advanced processes. We are eligible for these new incentives pursuant to the\nR.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation.\nThe alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) imposed under the R.O.C. AMT Act is a supplemental income tax which applies if the amount of regular\nincome tax calculated pursuant to the R.O.C. Income Tax Act and relevant laws and regulations is below the amount of basic tax prescribed under the\nR.O.C. AMT Act. The taxable income for calculating AMT includes most income that is exempt from income tax under various legislations, such as tax\nholidays. The prevailing AMT rate for business entities is 12%.\nWe were eligible for five-year tax holidays for income generated from construction and capacity expansions of production facilities according to\nregulations under the Statute for Upgrading Industries of the R.O.C.

The Climate Change\nResponse Act of the R.O.C., effective February 2023, set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions in Taiwan by 2050 and established a carbon fee system to\ncollect carbon fees. For emitters with direct and indirect emissions exceeding a certain threshold, carbon fees will be levied starting from 2025. As our\nemissions from each fab in Taiwan exceed the current regulatory threshold, we will start to pay carbon fees from 2026 (for the 2025 fees), which will\nresult in increased manufacturing costs for us. Also, the R.O.C. legislative authority is regularly reviewing various environmental issues to develop laws\nand regulations relating to environmental protection and climate change. The impact of such laws and regulations is currently indeterminable. Please see\ndetailed risk factors related to the impact of climate change regulations and international accords in “Item 3. Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks\nRelating to Our Business. ” Please also see our compliance record with Taiwan and international environmental and climate-related laws and regulations\nin “Item 4.

ADSs and common shares available for purchase by\nparticipants under the ESPP will be authorized and issued ADSs or authorized and issued common shares acquired by the administrator of the ESPP on\nbehalf of participants. We shall contribute to a participant’s contribution account so that fifteen percent (15%) of the purchase price for each ADS or\ncommon share purchased under the ESPP for a participant is funded by the employer contribution. We may, with thirty (30) days’ notice to eligible\nemployees, change such percentage for the employer contribution.\nCompensation\nAccording to our Articles of Incorporation, not more than 0.3 percent of our annual profits, after recovering any losses incurred in prior years, may\nbe distributed as compensation to our directors and at least one percent of our annual profits may be distributed as profit sharing bonuses to employees,\nincluding executive officers. Compensation to directors is always paid in cash, while bonuses to our executive officers may be granted in cash, stock, or\nstock options or the combination of all these three. Individual awards are based on each individual’s job responsibility, contribution and performance.\nSee note 29 to our consolidated financial statements. Under our Articles of Incorporation, directors who also serve as executive officers are not entitled\nto any director compensation.\n/nobreakspace\n46\nRemuneration of Directors\nThe following table presents the remuneration and benefits in kind accrued in 2024 for our non-employee directors:\n/nobreakspace\nName/Title   \nFees Earned or\nPaid in Cash    \nStock\nAwards   \nAll Other\nCompensation(6)   Total(7)  \n   NT$    NT$    NT$    NT$    US$ \n   (in millions)  \nMark Liu, Former Chairman(1)    345.7    —     0.9    346.6    10.6 \nF.C.

Ministry of Economic Affairs and other investors established VIS, then an integrated DRAM manufacturer. VIS\ncommenced commercial production in 1995 and listed its shares on the Taipei Exchange in March 1998. In 2004, VIS completely terminated its DRAM\nproduction and became a dedicated foundry company. As of February 28, 2025, we owned approximately 27.6% of the equity interest in VIS.\nPursuant to the terms of a manufacturing agreement between both parties, VIS was obligated to use its best commercial efforts to manufacture\nwafers at specified yield rates for us up to a fixed amount of reserved capacity per month, and TSMC was required to use its best commercial efforts to\nmaintain utilization of such reserved capacity. In 2024, we had total purchases of NT$759 million (US$23 million) from VIS, representing 0.1% of our\ntotal cost of revenue.\nSystems on Silicon Manufacturing Company Pte. Ltd. (“SSMC”)\nSSMC is a joint venture in Singapore that we established with Philips and EDB to produce integrated circuits by means of advanced submicron\nmanufacturing processes. These integrated circuits are made pursuant to the product design specifications provided primarily by us and Philips under an\nagreement with Philips and EDB (the “SSMC Shareholders Agreement”) in March 1999, and primarily by us and NXP, subsequent to the assignment by\nPhilips of its rights to NXP and NXP’s assumption of Philips’ obligations under the SSMC Shareholders Agreement pursuant to the Assignment and\nAssumption Agreement effective September 25, 2006. SSMC’s business is limited to manufacturing wafers for us, our subsidiaries, NXP and NXP’s\nsubsidiaries. On November 15, 2006, we and NXP exercised the option rights under the SSMC Shareholders Agreement to purchase all of the SSMC\nshares owned by EDB. As a result, we now own 38.8%, and NXP owns 61.2% of SSMC. While we, together with NXP, have the right to purchase up to\n100% of SSMC’s annual capacity, we and NXP are required to purchase, in the aggregate, at least 70% of SSMC’s full capacity. See below for a detailed\ndiscussion of the contract terms we entered into with SSMC.\nWe entered into a technology cooperation agreement with SSMC effective on March 30, 1999 in which SSMC agreed to base at least a major part\nof its production activities on processes compatible to those in use in our metal oxide semiconductor (“MOS”) integrated circuits wafer volume\nproduction fabs. In return, we agreed to provide SSMC with access to and benefit of the technical knowledge and experience relating to certain\nprocesses in use in our MOS integrated circuits wafer volume production fabs and to assist SSMC by rendering certain technical services in connection\nwith its production activities. In addition, we granted to SSMC limited licenses of related intellectual property rights owned or controlled by us for the\npurpose of MOS integrated circuit production for the sole use in manufacturing products for us. SSMC pays to us during, and up to three years after, the\nterm of this agreement a remuneration of a fixed percentage of the net selling price of all products manufactured by SSMC. In 2024, we had total\npurchases of NT$3,861 million (US$118 million) from SSMC, representing 0.3% of our total cost of revenue.\n/nobreakspace\n51\nGlobal Unichip Corporation (“GUC”)\nIn January 2003, we acquired a 52.0% equity interest in GUC, a SoC design service company that provides large scale SoC implementation\nservices.

These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against us and\nsettlement payments by us. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, we could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse\neffects on our operations. We are also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions.\nAny adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm our business and distract our\nmanagement, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or prospects, and subject us to potential significant legal liability.\nIn February 2025, Longitude Licensing Ltd. and Marlin Semiconductor Limited (collectively, “Marlin”) filed complaints with the U.S.\nInternational Trade Commission (“ITC”) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC and its customers infringe five\nU.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation on March 21, 2025. The outcome cannot be determined, and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the\ncontingent liability at this time.\nOther than the matter described above, we were not a party to any material litigation as of December 31, 2024 and are not currently a party to any\nother material litigation.\nDividends and Dividend Policy\nExcept as otherwise specified in the Articles of Incorporation or under the R.O.C. laws, we will not pay dividends or make other distributions to\nshareholders when there are no earnings.

Securities and Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated\nthereunder. Please refer to further information set forth in exhibit 1.1 to this annual report.\nGeneral\nOur authorized share capital is NT$280,500,000,000, divided into 28,050,000,000 common shares, of which 500,000,000 common shares are\nreserved for the issuance for our employee stock options and among which 25,932,733,242 common shares were issued and outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and February 28, 2025. No employee stock options were outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and February 28, 2025. On March 1,\n2025, we reclaimed 17,341 common shares, 26,380 common shares and 74,000 common shares formerly granted in the form of RSAs pursuant to our\n2021 Rules, 2022 Rules and 2023 Rules, respectively. Please see “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees – Share Ownership” for a\nfurther discussion.\nThe R.O.C. Company Act, the R.O.C. Act for Establishment and Administration of Science Parks and the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act\nprovide that any change in the issued share capital of a public company, such as us, requires the approval of its board of directors, (or, for capital\nreduction, a resolution of its shareholders meeting), the approval of, or the registration with, the R.O.C. FSC and the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the\nScience Park Administration (as applicable) and/or an amendment to its articles of incorporation (if such change also involves a change in the authorized\nshare capital).\nThere are no provisions under either R.O.C. law or the deposit agreement under which holders of ADSs would be required to forfeit the common\nshares represented by ADSs.\n/nobreakspace\n53\nDividends and Distributions\nAn R.O.C. company is generally not permitted to distribute dividends or to make any other distributions to shareholders in respect of any year for which\nit did not have either earnings or retained earnings. In addition, before distributing a dividend to shareholders following the end of a fiscal year, the\ncompany must recover any past losses, pay all outstanding taxes and set aside in a legal reserve, until such time as its legal reserve equals its paid-in\ncapital, 10% of its net income for that fiscal year (less any past losses and outstanding tax), and may set aside a special reserve.\nBefore the R.O.C. Company Act was amended in August 2018, the Board of Directors submitted our financial statements for the preceding fiscal\nyear and any proposal for the distribution of a dividend or the making of any other distribution to shareholders from our earnings or retained earnings\n(subject to compliance with the requirements described above) at the end of the preceding fiscal year to the shareholders for their approval at the annual\ngeneral meeting of our shareholders. All common shares outstanding and fully paid as of the relevant record date are entitled to share equally in any\ndividend or other distribution so approved. Dividends may be distributed in cash, in the form of common shares or a combination thereof, as determined\nby the shareholders at the meeting.\nThe R.O.C. Company Act, amended in August 2018, allows a company, as authorized by its articles of incorporation, to distribute dividends on a\nquarterly basis or a semi-annual basis and to have its board of directors to approve the dividends in cash. Our 2019 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting has\napproved the amendments to the Articles of Incorporation to authorize our Board of Directors to approve cash dividends after the close of each quarter.\nIn addition to permitting dividends to be paid out of earnings or retained earnings, the R.O.C. Company Act permits us to make distributions to\nour shareholders in cash or in the form of common shares from capital surplus and the legal reserve. However, dividend distribution out of our legal\nreserve can only be effected to the extent of the excessive amount of the accumulated legal reserve over 25% of our paid-in capital.\nFor information as to R.O.C. taxes on dividends and distributions, see “– Taxation – R.O.C. Taxation”.\nPreemptive Rights and Issues of Additional Common Shares\nUnder the R.O.C. Company Act, when a public company, such as us, issues new shares of common stock for cash, 10% to 15% of the issue must\nbe offered to its employees. The remaining new shares must be offered to existing shareholders in a preemptive rights offering, subject to a requirement\nunder the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act that at least 10% of these issuances must be offered to the public. This percentage can be increased by a\nresolution passed at a shareholders’ meeting, thereby limiting or waiving the preemptive rights of existing shareholders. The preemptive rights\nprovisions do not apply to limited circumstances, such as:\n/nobreakspace\n •  issuance of new shares upon conversion of convertible bonds; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  offerings of new shares through a private placement approved at a shareholders’ meeting.\nAuthorized but unissued shares of any class may be issued at such times and, subject to the above-mentioned provisions of the R.O.C.

The shares with respect to which preemptive\nrights have been waived may be freely offered, subject to compliance with applicable R.O.C. law.\nMeetings of Shareholders\nMeetings of our shareholders may be general meetings or special meetings. General meetings of shareholders are generally held in Hsinchu,\nTaiwan, within six months after the end of each fiscal year. Special meetings of shareholders may be convened by resolution of the Board of Directors\nwhenever it deems necessary, or under certain circumstances, by shareholders or the Audit Committee. For a public company such as us, notice in\nwriting of shareholders’ meetings, stating the place, time and purpose thereof, must be sent to each shareholder at least thirty days (in the case of general\nmeetings) and fifteen days (in the case of special meetings) prior to the date set for each meeting.\nVoting Rights\nA holder of common shares has one vote for each common share. Except as otherwise provided by law, a resolution may be adopted by the\nholders of a simple majority of the total issued and outstanding common shares represented at a shareholders’ meeting at which a majority of the holders\nof the total issued and outstanding common shares are present. The election of directors at a shareholders’ meeting is by cumulative voting. As\nauthorized under the R.O.C. Company Act and as required by the R.O.C. FSC, we have adopted a nomination procedure for election of our directors in\nour Articles of Incorporation. According to our Articles of Incorporation, ballots for the election of directors and independent directors are cast\nseparately.\n/nobreakspace\n54\nThe R.O.C. Company Act also provides that in order to approve certain major corporate actions, including but not limited to, (i) any amendment to\nthe articles of incorporation (which is required for, among other actions, any increase in authorized share capital), (ii) execution, modification or\ntermination of any contracts regarding leasing of all business or joint operations or mandate of the company’s business to other persons, (iii) the\ndissolution, amalgamation or spin-off of a company or the transfer of the whole or an important part of its business or its properties or the taking over of\nthe whole of the business or properties of any other company which would have a significant impact on the acquiring company’s operations, (iv) the\nremoval of directors or supervisors or (v) the distribution of any stock dividend, a meeting of the shareholders must be convened with a quorum of\nholders of at least two-thirds of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock at which the holders of at least a majority of the common stock\nrepresented at the meeting vote in favor thereof. However, in the case of a publicly held company such as us, such a resolution may be adopted by the\nholders of at least two-thirds of the shares of common stock represented at a shareholders’ meeting at which holders of at least a majority of the issued\nand outstanding shares of common stock are present.\nA shareholder may be represented at a shareholders’ meeting by proxy. A valid proxy must be delivered to us at least five days prior to the\ncommencement of the shareholders’ meeting.\nHolders of ADSs will not have the right to exercise voting rights with respect to the common shares represented thereby, except as described in\n“— V oting of Deposited Securities”.\nOther Rights of Shareholders\nUnder the R.O.C. Company Act, dissenting shareholders are entitled to appraisal rights in the event of amalgamation, spin-off or certain other\nmajor corporate actions. A dissenting shareholder may request us to redeem all of the shares owned by that shareholder at a fair price to be determined\nby mutual agreement or a court order if agreement cannot be reached. A shareholder may exercise these appraisal rights by serving a written notice on us\nprior to the related shareholders’ meeting and by raising an objection at the shareholders’ meeting. In addition to appraisal rights, any shareholder has the\nright to sue for the annulment of any resolution adopted at a shareholders’ meeting where the procedures were legally defective within thirty days after\nthe date of such shareholders’ meeting. One or more shareholders who have held one percent or more of our issued and outstanding shares for six\nmonths or longer may require the audit committee to bring a derivative action against a director for that director’s liability to us as a result of that\ndirector’s unlawful actions or failure to act.

In addition, if a company adopts a nomination procedure for\nelection of directors or supervisors in its articles of incorporation, shareholders representing 1% or more of the total issued shares of such company may\nsubmit a candidate list in writing to the company along with relevant information and supporting documents.\nRegister of Shareholders and Record Dates\nOur share registrar, CTBC Bank Co., Ltd., maintains the register of our shareholders at its office in Taipei, Taiwan. Under the R.O.C. Company\nAct, the transfer of common shares in registered form is effected by endorsement of the transferor’s and transferee’s seals on the share certificates and\ndelivery of the related share certificates. In order to assert shareholders’ rights against us, however, the transferee must have his name and address\nregistered on the register of shareholders. Shareholders are required to file their respective specimen signatures or seals with us. The settlement of\ntrading in the common shares is carried out on the book-entry system maintained by the Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation and therefore, the\nshare transfer will follow the procedures of the Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation.\nThe R.O.C. Company Act permits us to set a record date and close the register of shareholders for a specified period in order for us to determine\nthe shareholders or pledgees that are entitled to certain rights pertaining to common shares by giving advance public notice. Under the R.O.C.

Company Act. However, under the\nR.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, we may, by a board resolution adopted by majority consent at a meeting with two-thirds of our directors present,\npurchase our common shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or by a tender offer, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the R.O.C. FSC, for\nany of the following purposes: (i) to transfer shares to our employees; (ii) to satisfy our obligations to provide our common shares upon exercise or\nconversion of any warrants, convertible bonds or convertible preferred shares; or (iii) if necessary, to maintain our credit and our shareholders’ equity\n(such as for the purpose of supporting the trading price of our common shares during market dislocations), provided that the common shares so\npurchased shall be cancelled thereafter.\nWe are not allowed to purchase more than ten percent of our total issued and outstanding common shares. In addition, we may not spend more\nthan the aggregate amount of our retained earnings, premium from issuing stock and the realized portion of the capital reserve to purchase our common\nshares.\nWe may not pledge or hypothecate any purchased common shares.

The above sale and transfer of shares can be made only after that person (as well as his/her\nrespective spouse and minor children and its/his/her nominees) has held the shares for more than six months and that person should report to the R.O.C.\nFSC at least three days before the intended sale or transfer; unless the number of shares to be sold or transferred does not exceed 10,000.\nMaterial Contracts\nTSMC is not currently a party to any material contract, other than contracts entered into in the ordinary course of our business.\nForeign Investment in the R.O.C.\nSince 1983, the R.O.C. government has periodically enacted legislation and adopted regulations to permit foreign investment in the R.O.C.\nsecurities market.\nOn September 30, 2003, the R.O.C. Executive Yuan approved an amendment to Regulations Governing Investment in Securities by Overseas\nChinese and Foreign National, or the Regulations, which took effect on October 2, 2003. According to the Regulations, the R.O.C. FSC abolished the\nmechanism of the so-called “qualified foreign institutional investors” and “general foreign investors” as stipulated in the Regulations before the\namendment.\nUnder the Regulations, foreign investors are classified as either “onshore foreign investors” or “offshore foreign investors” according to their\nrespective geographical location. Both onshore and offshore foreign investors are allowed to invest in R.O.C. securities after they register with the\nTaiwan Stock Exchange. The Regulations further classify foreign investors into foreign institutional investors and foreign individual investors. “Foreign\ninstitutional investors” refer to those investors incorporated and registered in accordance with foreign laws outside of the R.O.C. (i.e., offshore foreign\ninstitutional investors) or their branches set up within the R.O.C. (i.e., onshore foreign institutional investors). Offshore overseas Chinese and foreign\nindividual investors may be subject to a maximum investment ceiling that will be separately determined by the R.O.C. FSC after consultation with the\nCentral Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Currently, there is no maximum investment ceiling for offshore overseas Chinese and foreign\nindividual investors. On the other hand, foreign institutional investors are not subject to any ceiling for investment in the R.O.C. securities market.\n/nobreakspace\n56\nExcept for certain specified industries, such as telecommunications, investments in R.O.C.-listed companies by foreign investors are not subject to\nindividual or aggregate foreign ownership limits. Custodians for foreign investors are required to submit to the Central Bank of the Republic of China\n(Taiwan) and the Taiwan Stock Exchange a monthly report of trading activities and status of assets under custody and other matters. Capital remitted to\nthe R.O.C. under these guidelines may be remitted out of the R.O.C. at any time after the date the capital is remitted to the R.O.C. Capital gains and\nincome on investments may be remitted out of the R.O.C. at any time.\nForeign investors (other than foreign investors who have registered with the Taiwan Stock Exchange for making investments in the R.O.C.\nsecurities market) who wish to make direct investments in the shares of R.O.C. companies are required to submit a foreign investment approval\napplication to the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs or other applicable government authority. The\nDepartment of Investment Review or such other government authority reviews each foreign investment approval application and approves or\ndisapproves each application after consultation with other governmental agencies (such as the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the\nR.O.C. FSC).\nUnder current R.O.C. law, any non-R.O.C. person possessing a foreign investment approval may repatriate annual net profits, interest and cash\ndividends attributable to the approved investment. Stock dividends attributable to this investment, investment capital and capital gains attributable to this\ninvestment may be repatriated by the non-R.O.C. person possessing a foreign investment approval after approvals of the Department of Investment\nReview or other government authorities have been obtained.\nIn addition to the g"}

Stock dividends attributable to this investment, investment capital and capital gains attributable to this\ninvestment may be repatriated by the non-R.O.C. person possessing a foreign investment approval after approvals of the Department of Investment\nReview or other government authorities have been obtained.\nIn addition to the general restriction against direct investment by non-R.O.C. persons in securities of R.O.C. companies, non-R.O.C. persons\n(except in certain limited cases) are currently prohibited from investing in certain industries in the R.O.C. pursuant to a “negative list”, as amended by\nthe R.O.C. Executive Yuan. The prohibition on foreign investment in the prohibited industries specified in the negative list is absolute in the absence of a\nspecific exemption from the application of the negative list. Pursuant to the negative list, certain other industries are restricted so that non-R.O.C.\npersons (except in limited cases) may invest in these industries only up to a specified level and with the specific approval of the relevant competent\nauthority that is responsible for enforcing the relevant legislation that the negative list is intended to implement.\nThe R.O.C. FSC announced on April 30, 2009 the Regulations Governing Mainland Chinese Investors’ Securities Investments (“P.R.C.\nRegulations”) and amended the same on October 6, 2010. According to the P.R.C. Regulations, a P.R.C. qualified domestic institutional investor\n(“QDII”) is allowed to invest in R.O.C. securities (including less than 10% (or less in certain industries) shareholding of an R.O.C. company listed on\nTaiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange.) Nevertheless, the total investment amount of QDIIs cannot exceed US$500 million. For each QDII,\nthe custodians of such QDIIs must apply with the Taiwan Stock Exchange for the remittance amount for each QDII, which cannot exceed\nUS$100 million, and QDII can only invest in the R.O.C. securities market with the amount approved by the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In addition, QDIIs\nare currently prohibited from investing in certain industries, and their investment of certain other industries in a given company is restricted to a certain\npercentage pursuant to a list promulgated by the R.O.C. FSC and amended from time to time. P.R.C. investors other than QDII, however, are prohibited\nfrom making investments in an R.O.C. company listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange, unless with approval from the\nDepartment of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs for its investment of 10% or more (or other percentage applicable to\ncertain restricted industries) of the equity interest of such R.O.C. company.\nIn addition to investments permitted under the P.R.C. Regulations, P.R.C. investors who wish to make (i) direct investment in the shares of R.O.C.\nprivate companies or (ii) investments, individually or aggregately, in 10% or more (or other percentage applicable to certain restricted industries) of the\nequity interest of an R.O.C. company listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange are required to submit an investment approval\napplication to the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs or other government authority. The Department of\nInvestment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs or such other government authority reviews investment approval application and\napproves or disapproves each application after consultation with other governmental agencies. Furthermore, P.R.C. investor who wishes to be elected as\nan R.O.C. company’s director or supervisor shall also submit an investment approval application to the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C.\nMinistry of Economic Affairs or other government authority for approval.\n/nobreakspace\n57\nDepositary Receipts\nIn April 1992, the R.O.C. FSC enacted regulations permitting R.O.C. companies with securities listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, with the\nprior approval of the R.O.C. FSC, to sponsor the issuance and sale to foreign investors of depositary receipts. Depositary receipts represent deposited\nshares of R.O.C. companies. In December 1994, the R.O.C. FSC allowed companies whose shares are listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or traded on\nthe Taipei Exchange, upon approval of the R.O.C.

A copy of our amended and restated deposit agreement has been filed under the cover of Form F-6 on November 16, 2007.\nA holder of depositary receipts (other than citizens of the P.R.C. and entities organized under the laws of the P.R.C. save for QDII or those which\notherwise obtain the approval of the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs) may request the depositary to either\ncause the underlying shares to be sold in the R.O.C. and to distribute the sale proceeds to the holder or to withdraw from the depositary receipt facility\nthe shares represented by the depositary receipts to the extent permitted under the deposit agreement (for depositary receipts representing existing\nshares, immediately after the issuance of the depositary receipts; and for depositary receipts representing new shares, in practice four to seven business\ndays after the issuance of the depositary receipts) and transfer the shares to the holder.\nWe, or the foreign depositary bank, may not increase the number of depositary receipts by depositing shares in a depositary receipt facility or\nissuing additional depositary receipts against these deposits without specific R.O.C. FSC approval, except in limited circumstances. These circumstances\ninclude issuances of additional depositary receipts in connection with:\n/nobreakspace\n •  dividends or free distributions of shares;\n/nobreakspace\n •  the exercise by holders of existing depositary receipts of their pre-emptive rights in connection with capital increases for  cash; or\n/nobreakspace\n \n•  if permitted under the deposit agreement and custody agreement, the deposit of common shares purchased by any person directly  or\nthrough a depositary bank on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange (as applicable) or held by such person for deposit in the\ndepositary receipt facility.\nHowever, the total number of deposited shares outstanding after an issuance under the circumstances described in the third clause above may not\nexceed the number of deposited shares previously approved by the R.O.C. FSC plus any depositary receipts created under the circumstances described\nin the first two clauses above. Issuances of additional depositary receipts under the circumstances described in the third clause above will be permitted to\nthe extent that previously issued depositary receipts have been cancelled and the underlying shares have been withdrawn from the depositary receipt\nfacility.\nUnder current R.O.C. law, a non-R.O.C. holder of ADSs who withdraws and holds the underlying shares must register with the Taiwan Stock\nExchange and appoint an eligible local agent to:\n/nobreakspace\n •  open a securities trading account with a local securities brokerage firm;\n/nobreakspace\n •  open an NT dollars bank account;\n/nobreakspace\n •  pay taxes;\n/nobreakspace\n •  remit funds; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  exercise rights on securities and perform other matters as may be designated by the holder.\nIn addition, a withdrawing non-R.O.C. holder must appoint a local custodian for handling confirmation and settlement of trades, safekeeping of\nsecurities and cash proceeds and reporting of information. Under existing R.O.C. laws and regulations, without meeting these requirements, holders of\nADSs that withdraw and hold the common shares represented by the ADSs would not be able to hold or subsequently transfer the common shares,\nwhether on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or otherwise.\n/nobreakspace\n58\nHolders of ADSs who are non-R.O.C. persons withdrawing common shares represented by ADSs are required under current R.O.C. law and\nregulations to appoint an agent in the R.O.C. for filing tax returns and making tax payments. This agent, a “tax guarantor”, must meet certain\nqualifications set by the R.O.C. Ministry of Finance and, upon appointment, becomes a guarantor of the withdrawing holder’s R.O.C. tax payment\nobligations. In addition, under current R.O.C. law, repatriation of profits by a non-R.O.C. withdrawing holder is subject to the submission of evidence of\nthe appointment of a tax guarantor to, and approval thereof by, the tax authority, or submission of tax clearance certificates or submission of evidencing\ndocuments issued by such agent (so long as the capital gains from securities transactions are exempt from R.O.C. income tax).\nUnder existing R.O.C. laws and regulations relating to foreign exchange control, a depositary may, without obtaining further approvals from the\nCentral Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) or any other governmental authority or agency of the R.O.C., convert NT dollars into other currencies,\nincluding U.S. dollars, in respect of the following: proceeds of the sale of shares represented by depositary receipts, proceeds of the sale of shares\nreceived as stock dividends and deposited into the depositary receipt facility and any cash dividends or cash distributions received.

Proceeds from the sale of the underlying shares withdrawn from the depositary receipt facility may be used for reinvestment in the Taiwan\nStock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nDirect Share Offerings\nSince 1997, the R.O.C. government has amended regulations to permit R.O.C. companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei\nExchange to issue shares directly (not through depositary receipt facility) overseas.\nOverseas Corporate Bonds\nSince 1989, the R.O.C. FSC has approved a series of overseas corporate bonds issued by R.O.C. companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange\nor the Taipei Exchange in offerings outside the R.O.C. Under current R.O.C. law, these overseas corporate bonds can be:\n/nobreakspace\n \n•  converted by bondholders, other than citizens of the P.R.C. and entities organized under the laws of the P.R.C. save for QDII  or those that\nhave obtained the approval of the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C.

Proceeds from the sale of the shares\nconverted from overseas convertible bonds may be used for reinvestment in securities listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or traded on the Taipei\nExchange, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nExchange Controls in the R.O.C.\nThe R.O.C. Foreign Exchange Control Statute and regulations provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks\ndesignated to handle such business by the R.O.C. FSC and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Current regulations favor trade-\nrelated foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used\nfreely by exporters, and all foreign currency needed for the importation of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated\nforeign exchange banks.\nTrade aside, R.O.C. companies and resident individuals may, without foreign exchange approval, remit to and from the R.O.C. foreign currency of\nup to US$100 million or its equivalent (or such other amount as determined by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from time to time at\nits discretion in consideration of the R.O.C.’s economic and financial conditions or the need to maintain the order of the foreign exchange market in the\nR.O.C.) and US$10 million or its equivalent (or such other amount as determined by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from time to\ntime at its discretion in consideration of the R.O.C.’s economic and financial conditions or the needs to maintain the order of the foreign exchange\nmarket in the R.O.C.), respectively, in each calendar year. Furthermore, any remittance of foreign currency into the R.O.C. by a R.O.C. company or\nresident individual in a year will be offset by the amount remitted out of R.O.C. by such company or individual (as applicable) within its annual quota\nand will not use up its annual inward remittance quota to the extent of such offset.

See “Item 3. Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks Relating to\nOwnership of ADSs – Your voting rights as a holder of ADSs will be limited”.\nExcept as described below, the holders will not be able to exercise the voting rights attaching to the common shares represented by the ADSs on\nan individual basis. According to provisions of the deposit agreement, the voting rights attaching to the common shares represented by ADSs must be\nexercised as to all matters subject to a vote of shareholders by the depositary bank or its nominee, who represents all holders of ADSs, collectively in the\nsame manner, except in the case of an election of directors. Directors are elected by cumulative voting unless our Articles of Incorporation stipulate\notherwise.\nIn the deposit agreement, the holders will appoint the depositary bank as their representative to exercise the voting rights with respect to the\ncommon shares represented by the ADSs.\nWe will provide the depositary bank with copies (including English translations) of notices of meetings of our shareholders and the agenda of\nthese meetings, including a list of the director candidates, if an election of directors is to be held at the meeting. The depositary bank will mail these\nmaterials, together with a voting instruction form to holders as soon as practicable after the depositary bank receives the materials from us. In order to\nvalidly exercise its voting rights, the holder of ADSs must complete, sign and return to the depositary bank the voting instruction form by a date\nspecified by the depositary bank.\nSubject to the provisions described in the second succeeding paragraph, which will apply to the election of directors done by means of cumulative\nvoting, if persons together holding at least 51% of the ADSs outstanding at the relevant record date instruct the depositary bank to vote in the same\nmanner in respect of one or more resolutions to be proposed at the meeting (other than the election of directors), the depositary bank will notify the\ninstructions to the chairman of our board of directors or a person he may designate. The depositary bank will appoint the chairman or his designated\nperson to serve as the voting representative of the depositary bank or its nominee and the holders. The voting representative will attend such meeting and\nvote all the common shares represented by ADSs to be voted in the manner so instructed by such holders in relation to such resolution or resolutions.\nIf, for any reason, the depositary bank has not by the date specified by it received instructions from persons together holding at least 51% of all the\nADSs outstanding at the relevant record date to vote in the same manner in respect of any resolution specified in the agenda for the meeting (other than\nthe election of directors), then the holders will be deemed to have instructed the depositary bank or its nominee to authorize and appoint the voting\nrepresentative as the representative of the depositary bank and the holders to attend such meeting and vote all the common shares represented by all\nADSs as the voting representative deems appropriate with respect to such resolution or resolutions, which may not be in your interests; provided,\nhowever, that the depositary bank or its nominee will not give any such authorization and appointment unless it has received an opinion of R.O.C.\ncounsel addressed to the depositary bank and in form and substance satisfactory to the depositary bank, at its sole expense, to the effect that, under\nR.O.C. law (i) the deposit agreement is valid, binding and enforceable against us and the holders and (ii) the depositary bank will not be deemed to be\nauthorized to exercise any discretion when voting in accordance with the deposit agreement and will not be subject to any potential liability for losses\narising from such voting.

Effective from 2018, dividends declared by us out of our retained earnings and distributed to the holders are subject to R.O.C.\nwithholding tax at 21% on the amount of the distribution in the case of cash dividends or on the par value of the common shares in the case of stock\ndividends unless a lower withholding rate is provided under a tax treaty between the R.O.C. and the jurisdiction where the holders are residents. Starting\n2019, no retained earnings tax paid can offset as a credit against the 21% withholding tax.\nDistribution of common shares or cash out of our capital reserves is not subject to R.O.C. withholding tax, except under limited circumstances.\nCapital Gains. Starting from January 1, 2016, capital gains realized from the sale or disposal of the common shares are exempt from R.O.C.\nincome tax under Article 4-1 of the R.O.C. Income Tax Act.\nSales of ADSs are not regarded as sales of R.O.C. securities and thus any gains derived from transfers of ADSs are not regarded as R.O.C.-sourced\nincome. Accordingly, any gains derived from transfers of ADSs by holders are not currently subject to R.O.C. income tax.\n/nobreakspace\n61\nSubscription Rights. Distributions of statutory subscription rights for common shares in compliance with R.O.C. law are not subject to any\nR.O.C. tax. Proceeds derived from sales of statutory subscription rights evidenced by securities are subject to securities transaction tax at the rate of\n0.3% of the gross amount received. Holders are exempt from income tax on capital gains from the sale of statutory subscription rights evidenced by\nsecurities. Proceeds derived from sales of statutory subscription rights not evidenced by securities are not subject to securities transaction tax but the\ncapital gains are subject to R.O.C. income tax at a fixed rate of 20%.\nSubject to compliance with R.O.C. law, we, at our sole discretion, can determine whether statutory subscription rights shall be evidenced by\nissuance of securities.\nSecurities Transaction Tax. A securities transaction tax, at the rate of 0.3% of the sales proceeds, will be withheld upon a sale of common shares\nin the R.O.C. Transfers of ADSs are not subject to R.O.C. securities transaction tax. Withdrawal of common shares from the deposit facility is not\nsubject to R.O.C. securities transaction tax.\nEstate and Gift Tax. R.O.C. estate tax is payable on any property within the R.O.C. left by a deceased, and R.O.C. gift tax is payable on any\nproperty within the R.O.C. donated by an individual. Estate tax and gift tax are currently payable at the progressive rates of 10%, 15% and 20%. Under\nR.O.C. estate and gift tax laws, common shares issued by R.O.C. companies are deemed located in the R.O.C. regardless of the location of the holder. It\nis unclear whether a holder of ADSs will be considered to hold common shares for this purpose.\nTax Treaty. The R.O.C. does not have a double taxation treaty with the United States. On the other hand, the R.O.C. has double taxation treaties\nwith Indonesia, Singapore, South Africa, Australia, Vietnam, New Zealand, Malaysia, North Macedonia, Israel, Gambia, the Netherlands, the United\nKingdom, Senegal, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Paraguay, Hungary, France, Eswatini, India, Slovakia, Switzerland, Germany, Thailand, Luxembourg,\nKiribati, Austria, Italy, Japan, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, Saudi Arabia and South Korea, which may limit the rate of R.O.C. withholding tax on\ndividends paid with respect to common shares in R.O.C. companies. The ADS holders may or may not be considered to hold common shares for the\npurposes of these treaties. The holders should consult their tax advisors concerning their eligibility for the benefits with respect to the ADSs.\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation\nThis section discusses the material United States federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of our common shares or ADSs.

These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. In addition, this section\nis based in part upon the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its\nterms. In general, for United States federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing ADSs, you will be treated as the owner of the shares\nrepresented by those ADSs. Exchanges of shares for ADRs, and ADRs for shares, generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax.\nYou are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of common shares or ADSs and you are, for United States federal income tax purposes:\n/nobreakspace\n •  a citizen or resident of the United States;\n/nobreakspace\n •  a United States domestic corporation, or other entity subject to United States federal income tax as a domestic corporation;\n/nobreakspace\n •  an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source; or\n/nobreakspace\n •  a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more United Stat es persons are\nauthorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\nA “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of common shares or ADSs that is not a United States person and is not a partnership for United States\nfederal income tax purposes.\nIf a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of the common\nshares or ADSs, the United States tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of\nthe partnership. A holder of the common shares or ADSs that is a partnership and partners in such a partnership should consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the United States federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of common shares or ADSs.\nThe tax treatment of your common shares or ADSs will depend in part on whether or not we are classified as a passive foreign investment\ncompany (“PFIC”), for United States federal income tax purposes. Except as discussed below under “—PFIC Rules”, this discussion assumes that we\nare not classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes.\nYou should consult your own tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local income tax and other tax consequences of owning and\ndisposing of common shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\nU.S. Holders\nTaxation of Distributions\nIf you are a U.S. holder, the gross amount of any distribution we pay in respect of your common shares or ADSs out of our current or accumulated\nearnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes), other than certain pro-rata distributions of our common shares,\nincluding the amount of any R.O.C. tax withheld, will be treated as a dividend that is subject to United States federal income taxation. Because we do\nnot expect to calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, a U.S. holder should expect that any distribution made by us to\nsuch holder will generally be treated as a dividend. If you are a noncorporate U.S. holder, dividends that constitute qualified dividend income will be\ntaxable to you at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that you hold our common shares or ADSs for more than 60 days\nduring the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding period requirements.

Dividends we pay with respect to\nthe ADSs will be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the ADSs are readily tradable on the NYSE or\nanother established securities market in the United States. Our ADSs are listed on the NYSE, and we therefore expect that dividends we pay with respect\nto the ADSs will be qualified dividend income. It is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to the common shares will be qualified dividend\nincome.\n/nobreakspace\n63\nThe dividend is taxable to you when you, in the case of common shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, receive the dividend actually or\nconstructively. The dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to United States corporations in respect of\ndividends received from other United States corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income will be the U.S.\ndollar value of the NT dollar payments made, determined at the spot NT dollar/U.S. dollar rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of\nwhether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period\nfrom the date of the dividend distribution to the date the payment is converted into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be\neligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the United\nStates for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\nSubject to generally applicable limitations and restrictions, it is possible that the R.O.C. taxes withheld from dividend distributions and paid over\nto the R.O.C. would be eligible for credit against your U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit\nlimitation with respect to dividends that are subject to the preferential tax rates. Dividends will generally be income from sources outside the United\nStates. Dividends will generally be “passive” income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you. The rules applicable to the\nUnited States foreign tax credit are complex, and you should consult your own tax adviser concerning the availability of the credit in your particular\ncircumstances.\nPro rata distributions of common shares by us to holders of common shares or ADSs may not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Accordingly,\nsuch distributions may not give rise to taxable foreign-source income against which the R.O.C. tax imposed on such distributions may be credited.\nTaxation of Capital Gains\nIf you are a U.S. holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your common shares or ADSs, you will recognize capital gain or loss for United\nStates federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount that you realize and your tax basis, determined in\nU.S. dollars, in your common shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a noncorporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the property is\nheld more than one year. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation\npurposes. Your ability to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations.\nPFIC Rules\nWe believe that our common shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes\nand we do not expect to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually, and thus\nmay be subject to change. It is therefore possible that we could become a PFIC in a future taxable year. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we\nwill not be considered by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to be a PFIC in current or future years.\nIn general, if you are a U.S. holder, we will be a PFIC with respect to you if for any taxable year in which you held our common shares or ADSs:\n/nobreakspace\n •  at least 75% of our gross income for the taxable year is passive income; or\n/nobreakspace\n •  at least 50% of the value, determined on the basis of a quarterly average, of our assets in such taxable year is attributable  to assets that\nproduce or are held for the production of passive income.\n“Passive income” generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents (other than certain rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a\ntrade or business), annuities and gains from assets that produce passive income and certain other specified categories of income.

If you make this\nelection, you will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above. Instead, in general, you will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any,\nof the fair market value of your common shares or ADSs at the end of the taxable year over your tax basis in your common shares or ADSs. These\namounts of ordinary income will not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital gains. You will\nalso be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the tax basis of your common shares or ADSs over their fair market value at\nthe end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). Your tax\nbasis in the common shares or ADSs will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts. Your gain, if any, recognized upon the sale of your\ncommon shares or ADSs will be taxed as ordinary income.\nAlso, where a company that is a PFIC meets certain reporting requirements, a U.S. holder could avoid certain adverse PFIC consequences\ndescribed herein by making a “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”) election to be taxed currently on its proportionate share of the PFIC’s ordinary income\nand net capital gains. U.S. holders will not be able to treat a company as a QEF if the company does not prepare the information that U.S. holders would\nneed to make a QEF election. We do not intend to prepare or provide the information that would enable U.S. holders to make a QEF election.\nIn addition, notwithstanding any election you make with regard to the common shares or ADSs, dividends that you receive from us will not\nconstitute qualified dividend income to you if we are a PFIC (or are treated as a PFIC with respect to you) either in the taxable year of the distribution or\nthe preceding taxable year. Moreover, your common shares or ADSs will be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during your\nholding period in your common shares or ADSs, even if we are not currently a PFIC. For purposes of this rule, if you make a mark-to-market election\nwith respect to your common shares or ADSs, you will be treated as having a new holding period in your common shares or ADSs beginning on the first\nday of the first taxable year beginning after the last taxable year for which the mark-to-market election applies. Dividends that you receive that do not\nconstitute qualified dividend income are not eligible for taxation at the preferential rates applicable to qualified dividend income.

As a result, U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning\nthe PFIC rules.\n/nobreakspace\n65\nInformation with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets\nU.S. holders that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of US$50,000 may be required to file an information\nreport with respect to such assets with their tax returns. “Specified foreign financial assets” may include any financial accounts maintained by foreign\nfinancial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and\nsecurities issued by non-U.S. persons, (ii) financial instruments and contracts held for investment that have non-U.S. issuers or counterparties and\n(iii) interests in foreign entities. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their ownership of common\nshares or ADSs.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nExcept as described in the section titled “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” below, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income or withholding tax on the payment of dividends and the proceeds from the disposition of common shares or ADSs unless: such item is\neffectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the United States and, in the case of a resident of a country\nwhich has a treaty with the United States and is eligible for the benefits of the treaty with the United States, such item is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed place of business, in the United States; or the non-U.S. holder is an individual who holds the\ncommon shares or ADSs as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition, certain other\nconditions are met, and such non-U.S. holder does not qualify for an exemption. If the first exception applies, the non-U.S. holder generally will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such item in the same manner as a U.S. holder unless otherwise provided in an applicable income tax\ntreaty; a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be subject to a branch profits tax with respect to such item\nat a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty). If the second exception applies, the non-U.S. holder generally will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the amount by which such non-U.S.\nholder’s capital gains allocable to U.S. sources exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources during the taxable year of disposition of the common\nshares or ADSs.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nU.S. holders generally are subject to information reporting requirements, on IRS Form 1099, with respect to dividends paid on common shares or\nADSs and on the proceeds from the sale, exchange or disposition of common shares or ADSs unless the holder is a corporation or otherwise establishes\na basis for exemption. In addition, U.S. holders are subject to back-up withholding on dividends paid on common shares or ADSs, and on the sale,\nexchange or other disposition of common shares or ADSs, unless each such U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number and a duly executed\nIRS Form W-9 or otherwise establishes an exemption. Non-U.S. holders generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding with\nrespect to dividends, or the proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of common shares or ADSs, provided that each such non-U.S. holder\ncertifies as to its foreign status on the applicable duly executed IRS Form W-8 or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax and the amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. holder’s or non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax\nliability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that certain required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nDocuments on Display\nThe U.S. SEC maintains a website www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding registrants, including the\nCompany, that file electronically with the U.S. SEC.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, primarily in currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks\nis hedged.\nForeign Currency Risk: Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of our capital expenditures are denominated\nin currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in the\nexchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact\non our revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars.\n/nobreakspace\n66\nWe use foreign currency derivatives contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments, such as\nforeign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated monetary assets and\nliabilities, net investments in foreign subsidiaries, and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of\nforeign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our total monetary assets and\nliabilities, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 would have decreased our net\nincome by NT$891 million and NT$1,906 million (US$58 million) in 2023 and 2024 respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting\npositions. For further information, please refer to note 8, note 11 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risks: We are exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to our investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in\ninterest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the\ninterest paid on our debt.\nThe objective of our investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy\ngenerally requires us to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The majority of our fixed\nincome investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) or\namortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their fair value are recognized through other\ncomprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost, changes in their fair value are not reflected in asset values unless the\nassets are sold.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on our fixed income investments, a hypothetical adverse interest rate change of 100 basis points across\nall maturities would have decreased our other comprehensive income by NT$3,842 million and NT$4,501 million (US$137 million) in 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively, after taking into account interest rate hedges. For further information, please refer to note 9, note 10, note 11 and note 33 to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe majority of our debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or\nthe carrying amount. For further information, please refer to note 18, note 19 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe have entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on our fixed income investments and\nanticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\nInflation Risk: We are subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of items such as raw materials and equipment used to\nproduce our products, wage expenses and employee benefits, electricity costs, and costs in relation to construction of fabs. Although we do not believe\nthat inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high inflation in the future may have an adverse effect\non our ability to maintain current levels of profit margin if the selling prices of our products and services do not increase with these increased costs.\nOther Market Risk: Our equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce the fair value of our\nholdings. We currently do not reduce our equity market exposure thr"}

We currently do not reduce our equity market exposure through hedging activities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we had investments in\nprivate equity securities mostly through a number of investment funds with a carrying value of NT$7,209 million and NT$7,823 million (US$239\nmillion), respectively. Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our equity investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, a hypothetical adverse\nprice change of 10% would have decreased our other comprehensive income by approximately NT$955 million and NT$1,013 million (US$31 million)\nin 2023 and 2024, respectively. The actual disposal value of these investments may be significantly different from their carrying value.

A company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/nobreakspace\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche\nTaipei, Taiwan\nRepublic of China\nApril 17, 2025\n/nobreakspace\nITEM 16A.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nTSMC’s corporate governance practices are governed by applicable Taiwan law, specifically, the R.O.C. Company Act and R.O.C. Securities and\nExchange Act, and also TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation. Also, because TSMC securities are registered with the U.S. SEC and are listed on the NYSE,\nTSMC is subject to corporate governance requirements applicable to NYSE-listed foreign private issuers.\nUnder Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, NYSE-listed non-US companies may, in general, follow their home country corporate\ngovernance practices in lieu of most of the new NYSE corporate governance requirements. However, all NYSE-listed foreign private issuers must\ncomply with NYSE Sections 303A.06, 303A.11, 303A.12(b), 303A.12(c) and 303A.14.\nItem 16G as well as NYSE Section 303A.11 requires that foreign private issuers disclose any significant ways in which their corporate governance\npractices differ from US companies under NYSE listing standards. This requirement is not intended to suggest that one country’s corporate governance\npractices are better or more effective than another. A NYSE-listed foreign private issuer is required to provide to its US investors, a brief, general\nsummary of the significant differences, either: (a) on the company website in English, or (b) in its annual report distributed to its US investors. To\ncomply with NYSE Section 303A.11, TSMC has prepared the comparison in the table below.\nThe most relevant differences between TSMC corporate governance practices and NYSE standards for listed companies are as follows:\n/nobreakspace\nNYSE Standards for US Companies\nunder Listed Company Manual\nSection 303A   TSMC Corporate Practices\nNYSE Section 303A.01 requires a NYSE-listed company to have a\nmajority of independent directors on its board of directors.\n  \nTaiwan law does not require a board of directors of publicly traded\ncompanies to consist of a majority of independent directors. Taiwan law\nrequires public companies meeting certain criteria to have at least three\nindependent directors but no less than one fifth of the total number of\ndirectors on its board of directors. Starting from 2024, public companies\nthat meet certain criteria are required to have a minimum of one-third of\ntheir directors serving as independent directors. In addition, Taiwan law\nrequires public companies to disclose information pertaining to their\ndirectors, including their independence status. Please see TSMC’s\nannual report and Form 20-F for the relevant year filed with the Taiwan\nauthorities and the U.S. SEC (both of which are available online at\nwww.tsmc.com) for information on the total number of TSMC directors\nand directors who would be considered independent under NYSE\nSection 303A.02 and Taiwan law.\n/nobreakspace\n73\n  \nNYSE Section 303A.02 establishes general standards to evaluate directors’\nindependence (no director qualifies as independent unless the board of\ndirectors affirmatively determines that the director has no material\nrelationship with the listed company either directly or as a partner,\nshareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the\nlisted company).   \nTaiwan law establishes comparable standards to evaluate director\nindependence. For further information, please consult TSMC’s Taiwan\nannual report for the relevant year.\n  \nNYSE Section 303A.03 requires non-management directors to meet at\nregularly scheduled executive meetings that are not attended by\nmanagement.\n  \nTaiwan law does not contain such a requirement. Except for meetings of\nsub-committees of the board of directors and those held by managing\ndirectors, Taiwan law does not allow separate board meetings of part but\nnot all of the board of directors.\n  \nNYSE Section 303A.04 requires listed companies to have a\nnominating/corporate governance committee comprised entirely of\nindependent directors which committee shall have a written charter\nestablishing certain minimum responsibilities as set forth in NYSE\nSection 303A.04(b)(i) and providing for an annual evaluation of the\ncommittee’s performance.\n  \nTaiwan law does not contain such a requirement.

TSMC, however, has\nestablished its Compensation Committee since 2003 (renamed as\n“Compensation and People Development Committee” effective as of\nFebruary 14, 2023), which has met the requirements under the Taiwan\nlaw. Taiwan law permits a non-director independent member, appointed\nby the board of directors, to serve as a member on the compensation\ncommittee, so long as such member meets the independent and other\nrequirements under the relevant Taiwan law. Also, as required by the\nTWSE, the compensation committee of the companies listed on the\nTWSE must consist of a majority of independent directors, and all the\nmembers of the compensation committee shall elect an independent\ndirector to act as the convener and the chairperson of the meeting.\nPlease see TSMC’s annual report and Form 20-F for the relevant year\nfiled with the Taiwan authorities and the U.S. SEC (both of which are\navailable online at \nwww.tsmc.com) for further information regarding the\ncomposition and functions of its compensation committee.\n  \nNYSE Section 303A.05(b) requires a compensation committee’s charter to\nestablish certain minimum responsibilities and to provide for an annual\nevaluation of the committee’s performance.\n  \nTaiwan law requires certain public companies, such as us, to establish a\ncompensation committee by September 30, 2011. TSMC, however, has\nestablished its Compensation Committee since 2003, which has met the\nrequirements under the Taiwan law, and TSMC’s Compensation and\nPeople Development Committee charter contains the same\nresponsibilities as those provided under NYSE Section 303A.05(b)(i)\nand mandates the committee to review the adequacy of its charter\nannually.\n  \nNYSE Section 303A.06 requires listed companies to have an audit\ncommittee that satisfies the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the\nExchange Act. Foreign private issuers must satisfy the requirements of\nRule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act by July 31, 2005.\n  \nTSMC voluntarily established its Audit Committee (renamed as “Audit\nand Risk Committee” effective as of February 14, 2023) before the\npromulgation of related Taiwan law. Our Audit and Risk Committee\nfully complies with both local law requirements and corporate\ngovernance standards.

TSMC currently has a\nwritten Audit and Risk Committee charter containing the same duties\nand responsibilities as those provided under Section 10A-3(b)(1) of the\nExchange Act.\n  \nNYSE Section 303A.07(b)(iii)(B) and (C) establishes audit committee\nobjectives: (i) to discuss the annual audited financial statements and the\nquarterly financial statements of the company with management and the\nindependent auditor, including the information disclosed under the heading\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations”; and (ii) to discuss the company’s press releases\nrelating to its earnings as well as the financial information and guidelines\nrelating to its earnings that are supplied to analysts and rating agencies.   \nTSMC’s written Audit and Risk Committee charter establishes the same\naudit committee objectives.\n  \nNYSE Section 303A.07(b)(iii)(G) requires an audit committee to establish\nclear policies for hiring external auditor’s employees.   \nTaiwan law does not contain such requirement.\n  \nNYSE Section 303A.07(c) requires each company to have an internal audit\nfunction that provides to the management and to the audit committee\nongoing assessments on the company’s risk management processes and\ninternal control system.\n  \nTaiwan law requires public companies to establish an internal audit\nfunction. Internal auditors are subject to strict qualification standards\nunder Taiwan law, which require the board of directors to approve the\nappointment of the head of a company’s internal audit function. TSMC’s\ninternal audit function has substantially the same responsibilities as\nprovided under NYSE Section 303A.07(d).\n/nobreakspace\n75\n  \nNYSE Section 303A.08 requires each company to give to shareholders the\nopportunity to vote on all equity based compensation plans and material\nrevisions thereto with certain exceptions.\n  \nTaiwan law imposes a similar requirement. Employee stock option plans\n(“ESOPs”) are required to be approved by the board of directors.\nShareholders’ approval is not required if the number of options granted\nunder the relevant ESOP does not exceed the reservation made in\nTSMC’s Articles of Incorporation and if the exercise price is not below\nthe price as determined by relevant regulations. Otherwise, any change\nto such reservation in the Articles requires shareholders’ approval.\nEmployee restricted stock awards are required to be approved by the\nboard of directors and the shareholders’ meeting with a quorum of\nholders of at least two-thirds of all issued and outstanding shares of\ncommon stock at which the holders of at least a majority of the common\nstock represented at the meeting vote in favor thereof.

In 2024, we organized a cybersecurity workshop for suppliers, sharing\nnetwork security defense solutions and practices. Nearly 800 participants from close to 500 suppliers attended the workshop, which received high\nrecognition from the suppliers. Moreover, we have collaborated with Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (“SEMI”) to set up a\nSemiconductor Cybersecurity Committee to promote security standards (SEMI E187) as well as security assessment methodology for improving the\nresilience of semiconductor supply chain. We also joined Semiconductor Manufacturing Cybersecurity Consortium (“SMCC”), which focuses on\nimportant cybersecurity topics and seeks to find solutions that will benefit the entire industry.

Our responsibility is to express an  opinion\non the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCA OB and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicab le rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the aud it to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial sta tements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating th e\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and risk committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures  that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments . The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken a s a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 2\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) - commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as equipment under installation\nand construction in progress (EUI/CIP) - Refer to Notes 5, 6, and 15\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for the ir\nintended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjecti ve\njudgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Chan ges in\nthese assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.\nGiven the subjectivity in determining the date to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP, performing audit procedures to evaluate the\nreasonableness of the Company’s judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:\n/nobreakspace\n1. We read the Company’s policy and understood the criteria used to determine when to commence depreciation.\n/nobreakspace\n2. We tested the effectiveness of the controls over the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP.\n/nobreakspace\n3.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\nMaterial accounting policies are summarized as follows:\nStatement of Compliance\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nBasis of Preparation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instrum ents\nthat are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair  value of\nthe consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 14\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe basis for the consolidated financial statements\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TSMC and entities controlled by TSMC (its\nsubsidiaries).\nIncome and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated statements of profit or loss and o ther\ncomprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Total\ncomprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this\nresults in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line w ith\nthose used by the Company.\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\nChanges in the Company’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing control over the subsidia ries\nare accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are\nadjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the  non-\ncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity an d\nattributed to shareholders of the parent.\nWhen the Company loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the differe nce\nbetween:\n/nobreakspace\n a. the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when contro l is lost;\nand\n/nobreakspace\n b. the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling i nterest.\nThe Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis\nas would be required if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.\nThe fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial\nrecognition of an investment in an associate.\nThe subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements\nThe detail information of the subsidiaries at the end of reporting period was as follows:\n/nobreakspace\n            Percentage of Ownership    \nName of Investor   Name of Investee   Main Businesses and Products   \nEstablishment\nand Operating Location   \nDecember 31,\n2023   \nDecember 31,\n2024   Note\n \nTSMC\n  \n \nTSMC North America\n  \n \nSales and marketing of integrated\ncircuits and other semiconductor\ndevices   \n \nSan Jose, California, U.S.A.\n  \n \n100%\n  \n \n100%\n  \n \n-\n  \nTSMC Europe B.V .

Impairment of financial assets\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including\naccounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial ass ets at\namortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrumen t has not\nincreased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss re sulting from\npossible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has b een a\nsignificant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected cr edit loss\nresulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\nThe Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to th eir\ncarrying amount through a loss allowance account, except for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for w hich the\nloss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 18\n c.

Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the consolidated statements of fi nancial position at\ncost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate  as well as the\ndistribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities an d contingent liabilities\nof an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount o f the investment.\nAny excess of the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over  the cost of acquisition,\nafter reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\nWhen necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by  comparing its\nrecoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss rec ognized forms part\nof the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable  amount of the\ninvestment subsequently increases.\nThe Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the Company ceases to have significant influence over an associate.\nWhen the Company retains an interest in the former associate, the Company measures the retained interest at fair value at that date. The difference\nbetween the carrying amount of the associate at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained  interest and any\nproceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of  the associate. In\naddition, the Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on t he same basis as\nwould be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. If the Company’s ownership inter est in an associate is\nreduced as a result of disposal, but the investment continues to be an associate, the Company should reclassify to profit or lo ss only a\nproportionate amount of the gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income.\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percenta ge, the resulting\ncarrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company’s proportionate interest in the net assets of the asso ciate. The\nCompany records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the\nCompany’s ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other investors, the p roportionate amount\nof the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the\nsame basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\nWhen a consolidated entity transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate a re recognized in the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.

The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilitie s adjusted for lease\npayments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the unde rlying assets.\nSubsequent measurement is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for cha nges in lease\nliabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated statements\nof financial position.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the  useful lives of the\nright-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease\nterms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use\nassets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which\ndepend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease\npayments are discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rates.\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recog nized over the lease\nterms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine\nthose payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease li abilities with a\ncorresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets.

The estimated useful life and amortization method\nare reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospecti ve\nbasis.\nImpairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that th e cash\ngenerating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-\ngenerating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the\nrecoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying\namount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata  based\non the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in pr ofit or\nloss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nTangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and\nequipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered\nan impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the e xtent of\nthe impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates t he\nrecoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation  can\nbe identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest\ngroup of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated fu ture cash\nflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of\nmoney and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying am ount of\nthe asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 23\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the r evised\nestimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been\ndetermined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impair ment\nloss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when\ncustomers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers’ specified\nlocations.\nRevenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for\nestimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally mad e and\nadjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, whi ch is\nclassified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nIn principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15 days from the end of the month of wh en\nthe invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect , the\nCompany measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\nEmployee Benefits\nShort-term employee benefits\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expec ted\nto be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\nRetirement benefits\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees\nhave rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing b enefit is\nrecognized based on actuarial calculations.\nDefined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit pla ns are\ndetermined using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

Remeasurement, comprising actua rial\ngains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in\nwhich they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will\nnot be reclassified to profit or loss.\nNet defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock represents the outstanding shares that the Company buys back from market, which is stated at cost and shown as a\ndeduction in shareholders’ equity. When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the commo n\nstock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury\nstock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock\ntransactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 24\nShare-based payment arrangements\n/nobreakspace\n a.

Dividends paid to employees  on\nrestricted shares which do not need to be returned if employees resign in the vesting period are recognized as expenses upon th e\ndividend declaration with a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings.\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of restricted shares for employees that are\nexpected to vest. The impact from such revision is recognized in profit or loss so that the cumulative expenses reflect the rev ised\nestimate, with a corresponding adjustment to capital surplus - restricted shares for employees.\n/nobreakspace\n b. Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements\nFor cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognized for the services acquired, measured at the fair value of the\nliability incurred. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair  value of\nthe liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\nTaxation\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax\nIncome tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the\nearnings arise and adjusted to the extent that distributions are approved by the shareholders in the following year.\nAdjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are ge nerally\nrecognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary\ndifferences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is pr obable\nthat taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and assoc iates,\nexcept where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary diff erence\nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in\nwhich the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\nCurrent and deferred tax for the year\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other compre hensive\nincome or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or\ndirectly in equity, respectively.\nGovernment Grants\nGovernment grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions\nattaching to them and that the grants will be received.\nGovernment grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire noncurrent assets\n(mainly including land use right and depreciable assets) are recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related assets\nand recognized as a reduced depreciation or amortization charge in profit or loss over the contract period or useful lives of the related\nassets.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY\nIn the application of the aforementioned Company’s accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates an d\nassumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimate s and\nassociated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may\ndiffer from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the\nyear in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision\naffects both current and future years.\nMaterial Accounting Judgments\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 5 are satisfied.\nCommencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and\nConstruction in Progress (EUI/CIP)\nAs described in Note 5, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for\ntheir intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves\nsubjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended\nmanner.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 26\nJudgments on Lease Terms\nIn determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or  not\nto exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise\ndate of the option. Main factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the\nimportance of the underlying asset to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in\ncircumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.\nKey Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\nEstimation of Sales Returns and Allowances\nSales returns and other allowance is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in consideration of different\ncontractual terms.

The net realizable value of the inventor y is\ndetermined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.\nImpairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill,\nthe Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific a sset\ngroups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic\nconditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.\nRealization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against whic h those\ndeferred tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires su bjective\njudgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be ut ilized\nand feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and\nregulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\nDetermination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates\nIn determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the\nmarket risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 27\n7.

As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined\nbenefit obligation.\nAssuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were\nheld constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$735.2 million and\nNT$697.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 respectively.\nThe sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it  is\nunlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\nFurthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calcula ted\nusing the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the\ndefined benefit obligation liability.\nThe Company expects to make contributions of NT$1,870.0 million to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from\nDecember 31, 2024.

During the implementation of such plans, the\nCompany must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management\nand segregation of duties.\n/nobreakspace\n c. Market risk\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and\nequity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\nForeign currency risk\nSubstantially all the Company’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated\nin currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuatio ns\nto its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar agains t\nNT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. The Company uses\nforeign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments,\nsuch as foreign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-\ndenominated monetary assets and liabilities, net investments in foreign operations, and certain forecasted transactions. These\nhedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and\nliabilities.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have\ndecreased its net income by NT$1,704.6 million, NT$891.0 million and NT$1,906.3 million, respectively, after taking into\naccount hedges and offsetting positions.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes i n\ninterest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair valu e\nof those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\nThe majority of the Company’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at\nFVTOCI or at amortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their\nfair value are recognized through other comprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost,\nchanges in their fair value are not\n/nobreakspace\nF - 68\nreflected in the carrying amount. Both classifications recognized in profit or loss if the assets are sold. The Company has\nentered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed incom e\ninvestments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from\nmovements in interest rates.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s fixed income investments at the end of the reporting period,\ninterest rates increase of 100 basis points (1.00%) across all maturities would have decreased the Company’s other\ncomprehensive income by NT$3,831.3 million, NT$3,842.0 million and NT$4,500.9 million for the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nThe majority of the Company’s debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would\nnot affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.\nOther price risk\nThe Company is exposed to convertible preferred stocks, equity instrument investments, and other investments price risk\narising from financial assets at FVTPL and FVTOCI.\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the investments mentioned above at the end of the reporting period, the\nnet income would have decreased by NT$1,073.4 million and NT$1,216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and\n2024, respectively, and the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$631.5 million, NT$954.9 million and\nNT$1,013.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n/nobreakspace\n d. Credit risk management\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the\nCompany. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing\nactivities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed\nseparately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company’s maximum\ncredit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\nBusiness related credit risk\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company’s outstanding accounts\nreceivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk\nexposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit\nrisk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nAs of December 31, 2023 a"}

This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company’s ten largest customers accounted for 91% and 93% of accounts receivable,\nrespectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.\nFinancial credit risk\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limitin g\nthe exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties\nand adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 69\nThe objective of the Company’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and\nsupport liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit\nexposure to any one issuer. The Company assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk in the invested\nsecurities since initial recognition by reviewing changes in external credit ratings, financial market conditions and material\ninformation of the issuers.\nThe Company assesses the 12-month expected credit loss and lifetime expected credit loss based on the probability of default\nand loss given default provided by external credit rating agencies. The current credit risk assessment policies are as follows:\n/nobreakspace\n Category\n  \nDescription\n  \nBasis for Recognizing\nExpected Credit Loss\n  \nExpected\nCredit Loss\nRatio\nPerforming\n  \nCredit rating is investment grade\non valuation date   \n12 months expected credit loss\n  \n0-0.1%\nDoubtful\n  \nCredit rating is non-investment\ngrade on valuation date   \nLifetime expected credit loss-not\ncredit impaired   \n- \nIn default\n  \nCredit rating is CC or below on\nvaluation date   \nLifetime expected credit loss-\ncredit impaired   \n- \nWrite-off\n  \nThere is evidence indicating that\nthe debtor is in severe financial\ndifficulty and the Company\nhas no realistic prospect of\nrecovery   \nAmount is written off\n  \n- \nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the expected credit loss increased NT$57.9 million, increased\nNT$35.8 million and increased NT$58.5 million, respectively.

On\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from discount for lack of marketability of\n10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will decrease by NT$52.7 million and NT$56.2 million, respectively,\nif discounts for lack of marketability increase by 1%.\nThe income approach utilizes discounted cash flows to determine the present value of the expected future economic\nbenefits that will be derived from the investment. On December 31, 2024, the Company mainly uses unobservable\ninputs, which include expected returns, discount rate of 8.6%, and discount for lack of marketability of 20%. On\nDecember 31, 2024, with other inputs remain equal, if discount rate increases by 1%, the fair value will decrease\nby NT$1,606.9 million; if discount for lack of marketability increases by 1%, the fair value will decrease by\nNT$140.8 million.\nFor the remaining few investments, the market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for which the recent\nfinancing activities of investees, the market transaction prices of the similar companies and market conditions are\nconsidered.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 74\n 3) Fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value\nExcept as detailed in the following table, the Company considers that the carrying amounts of financial instruments in the\nconsolidated financial statements that are not measured at fair value approximate their fair values.\nFair value hierarchy\nThe table below sets out the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities which are not required\nto be measured at fair value:\n/nobreakspace\n  December 31, 2023  \n  Carrying   Fair Value  \n  \nAmount\n  \nLevel 1\n  \nLevel 2\n  \nTotal\n \nFinancial assets             \nFinancial assets at amortized costs             \nCorporate bonds   $ 113,785.4    $ -      $ 113,694.4    $ 113,694.4  \nCommercial paper    18,371.7     -       18,385.3     18,385.3  \nGovernment bonds/Agency bonds    13,803.5     2,751.9     11,053.3     13,805.2  \n    \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \n     $ 145,960.6          $   2,751.9          $ 143,133.0          $ 145,884.9     \n    \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \nFinancial liabilities             \nFinancial liabilities at amortized costs             \nBonds payable   $ 920,897.5    $ -      $ 849,236.9    $ 849,236.9  \n    \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \n/nobreakspace\n  December 31, 2024  \n  Carrying   Fair Value  \n  \nAmount\n  \nLevel 1\n  \nLevel 2\n  \nTotal\n \nFinancial assets             \nFinancial assets at amortized costs             \nCorporate bonds   $ 171,980.2    $ -      $ 172,518.5    $ 172,518.5  \nCommercial paper    14,208.1     -       14,222.7     14,222.7  \nGovernment bonds/Agency bonds    4,379.5     4,353.4     -       4,353.4  \n                        \n  $ 190,567.8    $   4,353.4    $ 186,741.2    $ 191,094.6  \n    \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \nFinancial liabilities             \nFinancial liabilities at amortized costs                                     \nBonds payable   $ 983,752.5    $ -      $ 900,344.7    $ 900,344.7  \n    \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \nValuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 2 fair value measurement\nThe fair values of corporate bonds, the Company’s bonds payable and agency bonds are determined by quoted market\nprices provided by third party pricing services.\nThe fair value of commercial paper is determined by the present value of future cash flows based on the discounted curves\nthat are derived from the quoted market prices.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 75\n34.

Under a technical cooperation agreement with Industrial Technology Research Institute, the R.O.C. Government or its designee\napproved by TSMC can use up to 35% of TSMC’s capacity provided TSMC’s outstanding commitments to its customers are\nnot prejudiced. The term of this agreement is for five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for\nsuccessive periods of five years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of the end of\nreporting period, the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.\n/nobreakspace\n \nb. Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties\nformed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore. TSMC’s equity interest in SSMC\nwas 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V .\nFurther, TSMC and NXP B.V . purchased all the SSMC shares owned by EDB Investments Pte Ltd. pro rata according to the\nShareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V . currently own approximately 39%\nand 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. TSMC and NXP B.V . are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of\nSSMC’s capacity, but TSMC alone is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the\ncommitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is\nrequired to compensate SSMC for all related unavoidable costs. There was no default from the aforementioned commitment as\nof the end of reporting period.\n/nobreakspace\n \nc.

This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by\nreference to our registration statement on Form F-6, filed with the SEC on November 16, 2007, including any exhibits thereto. In the following\ndescription, references to “you” are to the person registered with the Depositary (as defined below).\nGeneral\nWe have appointed Citibank, N.A. (the “Depositary”) as the depositary bank for our ADSs pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, entered into among us,\nthe Depositary and the holders and owners of beneficial interests in our ADSs (the “Deposit Agreement’). The Depositary’s offices are located at 388\nGreenwich Street, 26th Floor, New York, NY 10013. The Depositary typically appoints a custodian to safekeep the securities on deposit. In this case, the\ncustodian is Citibank, N.A. Taipei Branch, located at 7F, No. 16, Nanking E. Road, Section 4, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.\nEach ADS represents ownership of five common shares on deposit with the custodian. The ADSs are normally evidenced by certificates that are\ncommonly known as American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). If you become an owner of ADSs, you will become a party to the Deposit Agreement\nand therefore will be bound to its terms and to the terms of the ADR that represents your ADSs. As a holder of ADSs, you appoint the Depositary to act\non your behalf in certain circumstances.\nAs an owner of ADSs, you may hold your ADSs either by means of an ADR registered in your name or through a brokerage or safekeeping account. If\nyou decide to hold your ADSs through your brokerage or safekeeping account, you must rely on the procedures of your broker or bank to assert your\nrights as an ADS owner. Please consult with your broker or bank to determine what those procedures are. This summary description assumes you have\nopted to own the ADSs directly by means of an ADR registered in your name and, as such, we will refer to you as the “holder”. When we refer to “you”,\nwe assume the reader owns ADSs or will own ADSs at the relevant time.\nVoting Rights and Procedures\nSee “Item 10. Additional Information – V oting of Deposited Securities”.\nDividends and Distributions\nAs a holder, you generally have the right to receive the distributions we make on the securities deposited with the custodian. Your receipt of these\ndistributions may be limited, however, by practical considerations, legal limitations and the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Holders will receive such\ndistributions under the terms of the Deposit Agreement in proportion to the number of ADSs held as of a specified record date.\nDistributions of Cash. Whenever we make a cash distribution for the securities on deposit with the custodian, the Depositary will arrange for the funds\nto be converted into U.S. dollars and for the distribution of the U.S. dollars to the holders subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable laws and\nregulations.\nThe conversion into U.S. dollars will take place only if practicable and only if the U.S. dollars are transferable to the United States. The amounts\ndistributed to holders will be net of the fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit Agr"}

Your receipt of these\ndistributions may be limited, however, by practical considerations, legal limitations and the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Holders will receive such\ndistributions under the terms of the Deposit Agreement in proportion to the number of ADSs held as of a specified record date.\nDistributions of Cash. Whenever we make a cash distribution for the securities on deposit with the custodian, the Depositary will arrange for the funds\nto be converted into U.S. dollars and for the distribution of the U.S. dollars to the holders subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable laws and\nregulations.\nThe conversion into U.S. dollars will take place only if practicable and only if the U.S. dollars are transferable to the United States. The amounts\ndistributed to holders will be net of the fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit Agreement.\nDistributions of Shares. Subject to applicable laws, whenever we declare a dividend in or make a free distribution of common shares for the securities\non deposit with the custodian, the Depositary may, and will upon our request, distribute to holders new ADSs representing the common shares deposited.\nOnly whole new ADSs will be distributed. Fractional entitlements will be sold and the proceeds of such sale will be distributed as in the case of a cash\ndistribution. If additional ADSs are not distributed, the ADS-to-common share ratio will be modified subject to applicable R.O.C. law, in which case\neach ADS you hold will represent rights and interests in the additional common shares so deposited.\nThe distribution of new ADSs or the modification of the ADS-to-common share ratio upon a distribution of common shares will be made net of the fees,\nexpenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit Agreement. In order to pay such taxes or governmental\ncharges, the Depositary may sell all or a portion of the new common shares so distributed.\nNo such distribution of new ADSs or modification of the ADS-to-common share ratio will be made if it would violate a law (i.e., U.S. securities laws). If\nthe Depositary does not distribute new ADSs or modify the ADS-to-common share ratio as described above, it is expected to use its best efforts to sell\nthe common shares received and would distribute the proceeds of the sales as in the case of a distribution in cash.\nDistributions of Rights. Subject to applicable laws, whenever we distribute rights to purchase additional common shares, we will assist the Depositary in\ndetermining whether it is lawful and reasonably practicable to distribute rights to purchase additional ADSs to holders.\nThe Depositary will establish procedures to distribute rights to purchase additional ADSs to holders if it is lawful and reasonably practicable to make the\nrights available to holders of ADSs, and if we provide all of the documentation contemplated in the Deposit Agreement (including opinions to address\nthe legality of the transaction). You may have to pay fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges to subscribe for the new ADSs upon the\nexercise of your rights.\nIn circumstances in which rights would not otherwise be distributed, if you request the distribution of warrants or other instruments in order to exercise\nthe rights allocable to your ADSs, the Depositary will make such rights available to you as allowed by applicable law upon written notice from us. Our\nnotice to the Depositary must indicate that:\n \n •  we have elected in our sole discretion to permit the rights to be exercised; and\n \n •  you have executed such documents as we have determined in our sole discretion are reasonably required under applicable law.\nThe Depositary may sell the rights that are not exercised or not distributed if such sale is lawful and reasonably practicable. The proceeds of such sale\nwill be allocated to the account of the holders otherwise entitled to the rights. If the Depositary is unable to sell the rights, it will allow the rights to\nlapse.\nOther Distributions. Subject to applicable laws, whenever we distribute property other than cash, common shares or rights in respect of the deposited\nsecurities, the Depositary will determine whether such distribution to holders is feasible. If it is feasible to distribute such property to you, the\nDepositary will distribute the property to the holders in a manner it deems practicable. If the Depositary considers such distribution not to be feasible, it\nmay sell all or a portion of the property received. The proceeds of such a sale will be distributed to holders as in the case of a distribution in cash.\nAny distribution will be made net of fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit Agreement.\nTransmittal of Notices, Reports and Communications\nThe Depositary will make available for inspection by holders at its principal office any reports and communications received from us which are both\n(a) received by the Depositary as representative of the holder of record of the deposited securities, and (b) made generally available to the holders of\nsuch deposited securities by us. The Depositary will also promptly provide or make available to the holders copies of such reports and communications\nwhen furnished by us pursuant to the Deposit Agreement. In addition, we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and,\naccordingly, file certain reports with the SEC. Such reports and documents can be retrieved from the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov).\nIssuance of ADSs upon Deposit of Common Shares\nUnder current R.O.C. law, no deposit of common shares may be "}

Financial Supervisory Commission (plus any ADSs created pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above) and subject to any\nadjustment in the number of common shares represented by each ADS. Under current R.O.C. law, issuances under clause (iii) above will be permitted\nonly to the extent that previously issued ADSs have been cancelled and the underlying shares have been withdrawn from the ADR facility. The\nDepositary will refuse to accept common shares for deposit pursuant to clause (iii) unless it receives satisfactory legal opinions as described in the\nDeposit Agreement. In addition, the Depositary may, or if so directed by us, will, refuse to accept common shares for deposit whenever we have notified\nthe Depositary that (i) there are outstanding common shares with rights, including rights to dividends, that are different from the common shares held by\nthe Depositary, (ii) we have restricted the transfer of these common shares to comply with delivery, transfer or ownership restrictions referred to in the\nDeposit Agreement or under applicable law or otherwise or (iii) we have otherwise restricted the deposit of common shares pursuant to the Deposit\nAgreement.\nThe Depositary may create ADSs on your behalf if you or your broker deposits common shares with the custodian and meets the foregoing\nrequirements. The Depositary will deliver these ADSs to the person you indicate only after you pay any applicable fees, charges and taxes payable for\nthe transfer of the common shares to and the issuance and delivery of the ADSs by the Depositary or custodian.\nThe issuance of ADSs may be delayed until the Depositary or the custodian receives confirmation that all required approvals have been given and that\nthe common shares have been duly transferred to the custodian. The Depositary will only issue ADSs in whole numbers.\nWhen you make a deposit of common shares, you will be responsible for transferring good and valid title to the Depositary. As such, you will be deemed\nto represent and warrant that:\n \n •  the common shares are duly and validly authorized, issued and outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable and free of any pree mptive\nrights;\n \n •  you are duly authorized to deposit the common shares; and\n \n •  the common shares are not restricted securities and your deposit of common shares is not restricted by United States federal securities laws\nand does not violate the Deposit Agreement.\nIf any of the representations or warranties are incorrect in any way, we and the Depositary may, at your cost and expense, take any and all actions\nnecessary to correct the consequences of the misrepresentations.\nChanges Affecting Common Shares\nThe common shares held on deposit for your ADSs may change from time to time. For example, there may be a change in nominal or par value,\na split-up, consolidation or reclassification of such common shares, or a recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets.\nIf any such change were to occur, your ADSs would, to the extent permitted by law, represent the right to receive the property received or exchanged in\nrespect of the common shares held on deposit. The Depositary may in such circumstances deliver new ADSs to you or call for the exchange of your\nexisting ADSs for new ADSs. If the Depositary may not lawfully distribute such property to you, the Depositary may sell such property and distribute\nthe net proceeds to you in cash.\nAmendments and Termination\nWe may agree with the Depositary to modify the Deposit Agreement at any time without your consent. We undertake to give holders 30 days’ prior\nnotice of any modifications that would prejudice any of their substantial rights under the Deposit Agreement (except in very limited circumstances\nenumerated in the Deposit Agreement).\nYou will be bound by the modifications to the Deposit Agreement if you continue to hold your ADSs after the modifications to the Deposit Agreement\nbecome"}

We undertake to give holders 30 days’ prior\nnotice of any modifications that would prejudice any of their substantial rights under the Deposit Agreement (except in very limited circumstances\nenumerated in the Deposit Agreement).\nYou will be bound by the modifications to the Deposit Agreement if you continue to hold your ADSs after the modifications to the Deposit Agreement\nbecome effective. The Deposit Agreement cannot be amended to prevent you from withdrawing the common shares represented by your ADSs (except\nto comply with applicable law).\nWe have the right to direct the Depositary to terminate the Deposit Agreement. Similarly, the Depositary may in certain circumstances on its own\ninitiative terminate the Deposit Agreement. In either case, the Depositary must give notice to the holders at least 60 days before termination.\nUpon termination, the following will occur under the Deposit Agreement:\n \n \n•  for a period of six months after termination, you will be able to request the cancellation of your ADSs and the withdrawal of  the common\nshares represented by your ADSs and the delivery of all other property held by the Depositary in respect of those common shares on the\nsame terms as prior to the termination. During this six-month period, the Depositary will continue to collect all distributions received on\nthe common shares on deposit (i.e., dividends) but will not distribute any property to you until you request the cancellation of your ADSs;\nand\n \n \n•  after the expiration of the six-month period, the Depositary may sell the securities held on deposit. The Depositary will hol d the proceeds\nfrom such sale and any other funds then held for the holders of ADSs in a non-interest bearing account. At that point, the Depositary will\nhave no further obligations to holders other than to account for the funds then held for the holders of ADSs still outstanding.\nRights to Inspect the Books of the Depositary and the List of Holders\nThe Depositary will maintain ADS holder records at its depositary office. You may inspect such records at that office during regular business hours, but\nsolely for the purpose of communicating with other holders in the interest of our business or matters relating to the ADSs and the Deposit Agreement.\nThe Depositary will maintain in The City of New York facilities to record and process the execution and delivery, registration, registration of transfers\nand surrender of ADRs. These facilities may be closed from time to time, to the extent not prohibited by law.\nWithdrawal of Common Shares Upon Cancellation of ADSs\nYou may withdraw and hold the common shares represented by your ADSs unless you are a citizen of the PRC, or an entity organized under the laws of\nthe PRC or request the Depositary to sell the common shares represented by your ADSs. If you are a non-R.O.C. person and elect to withdraw common\nshares and hold the withdrawn common shares, you will be required to appoint a tax guarantor as well as an agent and a custodian in the R.O.C.\nIn order to withdraw the common shares represented by your ADSs, you will be required to pay to the depositary the fees for cancellation of ADSs and\nany charges and taxes payable upon the transfer of the common shares being withdrawn. You assume the risk for delivery of all funds and securities\nupon withdrawal. Once cancelled, the ADSs will not have any rights under the Deposit Agreement.\nIf you hold any ADSs registered in your name, the Depositary may ask you to provide proof of citizenship, residence, tax payer status, exchange control\napproval, payment of taxes and other governmental charges, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and certain other documents as the\nDepositary may deem appropriate before it will effect any withdrawal of the common shares represented by such ADS. The withdrawal of the common\nshares represented by your ADSs may be delayed until the Depositary receives satisfactory evidence of compliance with all applicable laws and\nregulations. If the common shares are withdrawn to or for the account of any person other than the person receiving the proceeds from the sale of ADSs,\nsuch evidence may include the disclosure of:\n \n •  your name;\n \n •  the name and nationality (and the identity number, if such person is an R.O.C. citizen) of any person in whose name the commo n shares\nyou are withdrawing will be registered;\n \n •  the number of common shares such person will receive upon such withdrawal;\n \n •  the aggregate number of common shares such person has received upon all withdrawals since the establishment of the depositary  facility;\nand\n \n •  any other information that we or the Depositary may deem necessary or desirable to comply with any R.O.C. disclosure or repor ting\nrequirements.\nThe Depositary will only accept ADSs for cancellation that represent a whole number of common shares on deposit.

These\ntransactions are commonly referred to as “pre-release transactions”. The Deposit Agreement limits the aggregate size of pre-release transactions and\nimposes a number of conditions on such transactions (i.e., the need to receive collateral, the type of collateral required, the representations required from\nbrokers, etc.). The Depositary may retain the compensation received from the pre-release transactions.\nLimitations on Obligations and Liabilities\nThe Deposit Agreement is governed by New York law. However, our obligations to the holders of common shares will continue to be governed by the\nlaws of the R.O.C., which may be different from the laws in the United States. The Deposit Agreement limits our obligations and the Depositary’s\nobligations to you. Please note the following:\n \n •  We and the Depositary are obligated only to take the actions specifically stated in the depositary agreement without negligen ce and in good\nfaith.\n \n •  The Depositary disclaims any liability for any failure to carry out voting instructions, for any manner in which a vote is ca st or for the\neffect of any vote, provided it acts in good faith and in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement.\n \n •  The Depositary disclaims any liability to monitor or enforce our obligations under the Deposit Agreement, including our oblig ation to\nreplace the certificate of payment in respect of common shares.\n \n •  We and the Depositary will not be obligated to perform any act that is not set forth in the Deposit Agreement.\n \n \n•  We and the Depositary disclaim any liability if we are prevented or forbidden from acting on account of any law or regulation , any\nprovision of our Articles of Incorporation, any provision of any securities on deposit or by reason of any act of God or war or other\ncircumstances beyond our control.\n \n •  We and the Depositary disclaim any liability by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided fo r in the Deposit\nAgreement.\n \n \n•  We and the Depositary further disclaim any liability for any action or inaction in reliance on the advice or information rece ived from legal\ncounsel, accountants, any person presenting common shares for deposit, any holder of ADSs or authorized representative thereof, or any\nother person believed by either of us in good faith to be competent to give such advice or information.\n \n •  We and the Depositary also disclaim liability for the inability by a holder to benefit from any distribution, offering, right  or other benefit\nwhich is made available to holders of common shares but is not, under the terms of the Deposit Agreement, made available to that holder.\n \n •  We and the Depositary may rely without any liability upon any written notice, request or other document believed to be genuin e and to\nhave been signed or presented by the proper parties.\nC.

The Issuer, the\nGuarantor and the Trustee may not, however, without the consent of each holder of the Notes of the series affected thereby:\n(i) change the Stated Maturity of such series of Notes;\n(ii) reduce the principal amount of, payments of interest on or stated time for payment of interest on any Notes of such series;\n(iii) change any obligation of the Issuer or the Guarantor to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such series of Notes or the related Guarantee,\nrespectively;\n(iv) change any obligation of the Guarantor to make payments under the Guarantee with respect to such series of Notes;\n(v) change the currency of payment of the principal of or interest on such series of Notes;\n(vi) impair the right to receive payment of the principal of or interest on (including Additional Amounts) such series of Notes on the stated\nmaturity date for such payment expressed in such series of Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement of such payment;\n(vii) reduce the above stated percentage of outstanding Notes of such series necessary to modify or amend the Indenture;\n(viii) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series necessary for waiver of compliance with certain\nprovisions of the Indenture or for waiver of certain Defaults;\n(ix) modify the provisions of the Indenture with respect to modification and waiver; or\n(x) reduce the amount of the premium payable upon the redemption or repurchase of any Notes of such series or change the time at which any\nNotes of such series may be redeemed or repurchased as described above under “—Optional Redemption” whether through an amendment or waiver of\nprovisions in the covenants, definitions or otherwise.\nThe holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of a series of Notes may on behalf of all holders of that series of Notes waive any existing or\npast Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture, except a continuing Default or Event of Default (i) in the payment of\nprincipal of, or interest on (or Additional Amounts payable in respect of), the relevant Notes then outstanding or the payment of any amounts due under\nthe relevant Guarantee, in which event the consent of all holders of that series of Notes is required; or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision that\nunder the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of that series of Notes then outstanding affected thereby. Any\nsuch waivers will be conclusive and binding on all holders of the relevant series of Notes, whether or not they have given consent to such waivers, and\non all future holders of such series of Notes, whether or not notation of such waivers is made upon the relevant Notes. Any instrument given by or on\nbehalf of any holder of any Notes in connection with any consent to any such waiver will be irrevocable once given and will be conclusive and binding\non all subsequent holders of any such Notes.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder, the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend the Indenture, the Notes of each\nseries and the Guarantees to, among other things:\n(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; provided, however, that such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the\nrights of holders of the relevant series of Notes;\n(ii) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantee under the Indenture and a series of Notes in\naccordance with “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”;\n(iii) provide for or facilitate the issuance of uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; provided that the uncertificated\nNotes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code;\n(iv) comply with the rules of any applicable depositary;\n(v) make any change that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any holder in any material respect;\n(vi) evidence and provide for the acceptance of an appointment under the Indenture of a successor trustee; provided that the successor trustee is\notherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of the Indenture;\n(vii) conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees to any provision under “Description of the Notes and the Guarantees” in the\nprospectus supplement relating to the Notes;\n(viii) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes or the Guarantees as permitted by the\nIndenture, including, but not limited to, amendments made to facilitate the issuance and administration of the Notes or the Guarantees or, if incurred in\ncompliance with the Indenture, Additional Notes; pr"}

It is\nsufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under\nthe Indenture by any holder given in connection with a tender of such holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. After an amendment,\nsupplement or waiver under the Indenture becomes effective, the Issuer is required to give to the holders of the affected Notes a notice briefly describing\nsuch amendment, supplement or waiver. However, the failure to give such notice to all such holders, or any defect in the notice will not impair or affect\nthe validity of the amendment, supplement or waiver.\nEvents of Default\nFor each series of Notes, each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture for such series of Notes:\n(i) failure to pay principal or premium in respect of any Notes of such series by the due date for such payment, but in the case of technical or\nadministrative difficulties, only if the default continues for a period of two days;\n(ii) failure to pay interest on any Notes of such series within 30 days after the due date for such payment;\n(iii) the Issuer or the Guarantor defaults in the performance of or breaches its obligations under the “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”\ncovenant;\n(iv) the Issuer or the Guarantor defaults in the performance of or breaches any covenant or agreement in the Indenture or under such series of\nNotes (other than a default specified in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above) and such default or breach continues for a period of 90 consecutive days after\nwritten notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor, as applicable, by the Trustee or the holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of such series\nof Notes then outstanding;\n(v) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (a) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Issuer or the Guarantor in an\ninvoluntary case or proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or (b) a decree or order adjudging the Issuer or the\nGuarantor bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as final and nonappealable a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition of\nor in respect of the Issuer or the Guarantor under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or appointing a custodian, receiver,\nliquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator, or other similar official of the Issuer or the Guarantor or of any substantial part of their respective property, or\nordering the winding up or liquidation of their respective affairs (or any similar relief granted under any foreign laws), and the continuance of any such\ndecree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive calendar days;\n(vi) the commencement by the Issuer or the Guarantor of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable state or foreign bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it t"}

This Rules applies to TSMC’s subsidiaries (i.e., 50%+ equity ownership) and TSMC’s affiliates in\nwhich TSMC has controlling power.\nThis Rules applies to any transactions in Company securities or futures, including common stock, American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), and any\nother publicly traded securities or future contracts the Company or third parties may issue from time-to-time, including but not limited to call(put)\nwarrants, stock futures, and stock options, as well as securities or futures of TSMC’s subsidiaries, affiliates, customers, suppliers and vendors.\n \nII. Scope\n \n A. What is Prohibited?\n \n 1. TSMC Securities\nAnyone covered by this Rules is prohibited to:\n \n (1) buy or sell any TSMC securities or engage in any derivatives or futures transactions involving TSMC securities while in\npossession of Material Non-public Information of TSMC; or\n \n (2) pass such information to others who then buy or sell TSMC securities or engage in any derivatives or futures transactions\ninvolving TSMC securities.\n \n1/4\nAny person who possesses Material Non-public Information regarding the Company is considered an “insider” for so long as the\ninformation is not known publicly.1 No insider may buy, sell or exercise rights (“trade”) in any publicly traded TSMC securities,\nderivatives or futures while possessing Material Non-public Information.\nIt would also be a violation of this Rules for any employee, officer, Board Director, or any person having a duty of trust or\nconfidence to pass Material Non-public Information learned or developed through TSMC employment or service on to others\n(“tipping”) who then trade in TSMC securities, derivatives or futures. Accordingly, an employee, officer, Board Member or any\nperson having a duty of trust or confidence shall not:\n \n - disclose Material Non-public Information to any TSMC employee who does not need to know the information to do their\njob;\n \n - provide Material Non-public Information to family members, business acquaintances, friends or anyone else; or\n \n \n- recommend to anyone that they trade in TSMC securities, derivatives or futures while he/she is in possession of Material\nNon-public Information, even if the employee, officer or Board Director does not disclose the specific information to that\nperson.\n \n 2. Trading on Securities, Derivatives or Futures of Subsidiaries, Affiliates, Customers, Suppliers and Vendors\nThe restriction on “insider trading” includes trading in the securities, derivatives or futures of TSMC’s subsidiaries and affiliates\n(where applicable) and securities, derivatives or futures of those that are current or prospective customers or suppliers of TSMC and\nthose with which TSMC may currently be negotiating. This Rules prohibits tipping and any such insider trading based on non-public\nmaterial information.\n \n B. “Material Non-Public Information” Defined\n“Non-public information” is information that is known within TSMC that has not been publicly released. “Material information” is\ninformation either that could be expected to affect or influence the market price of the Company’s securities or that a reasonable investor\nwould consider important in deciding to buy or sell TSMC securities. Material information can be favorable or unfavorable, positive or\nnegative.\n \n1 If a person would be in possession of Material Non-public Information at the time he/she would lose status as a TSMC Board Mem ber, officer,\nmanager or staff member, then within a 6-month period from date of last employment, Taiwan law will consider the person to be an insider of TSMC\nand, therefore, the same trading prohibitions will apply to such person for that 6-month period.\n \n2/4\nWhether any particular information would be considered “Material,” depends on the specific circumstances existing at a particular point of\ntime. Nevertheless, certain types of information are particularly sensitive for which special care and consideration in evaluation and\njudgment is required, such as: quarterly and annual financial results; projections of future earnings or losses; news of planned investment,\nmerger or acquisition; new equity offering; major changes in senior officers or Board Members, etc. These examples are not exhaustive. If\na person is in doubt as to whether the non-public information he/she has knowledge of is “Material”, the person should treat the\ninformation as if it were “Material” first, and consult with either the Company’s General Counsel or CFO for guidance before trading in\nany Company securities, derivatives or futures.\nMaterial Non-public Information shall be deemed to exist whenever a specific policy, decision, action plan, etc., that could reasonably\nimpact the share price of TSMC has been finally approved by either TSMC senior management, TSMC Chief Executive Officer, or the\nBoard of Directors and such information will be released publicly in the foreseeable future.\n \n C. Internet Chat Room Guidelines\nNo employee, officer or Board Member may participate, in any manner other than passive observation, in any of the investment or stock-\nrelated Internet “chat” rooms or message boards relating to the Company.\n \n D. Non-Trading Period\nIf an employee is in possession of Material Non-public Information, he/she must not trade in TSMC securities, derivatives or futures\nbefore such information has been disclosed publicly.

Nevertheless, certain types of information are particularly sensitive for which special care and consideration in evaluation and\njudgment is required, such as: quarterly and annual financial results; projections of future earnings or losses; news of planned investment,\nmerger or acquisition; new equity offering; major changes in senior officers or Board Members, etc. These examples are not exhaustive. If\na person is in doubt as to whether the non-public information he/she has knowledge of is “Material”, the person should treat the\ninformation as if it were “Material” first, and consult with either the Company’s General Counsel or CFO for guidance before trading in\nany Company securities, derivatives or futures.\nMaterial Non-public Information shall be deemed to exist whenever a specific policy, decision, action plan, etc., that could reasonably\nimpact the share price of TSMC has been finally approved by either TSMC senior management, TSMC Chief Executive Officer, or the\nBoard of Directors and such information will be released publicly in the foreseeable future.\n \n C. Internet Chat Room Guidelines\nNo employee, officer or Board Member may participate, in any manner other than passive observation, in any of the investment or stock-\nrelated Internet “chat” rooms or message boards relating to the Company.\n \n D. Non-Trading Period\nIf an employee is in possession of Material Non-public Information, he/she must not trade in TSMC securities, derivatives or futures\nbefore such information has been disclosed publicly. For purposes of this Rules, information will be considered public i.e., no longer\n“nonpublic,” at the opening of trading on the second full trading day following the Company’s public release of the information.\nTrading in TSMC securities, derivatives or futures is also prohibited whenever an internal announcement to that effect is circulated by the\nCFO and/or General Counsel for such events including, but not limited to the Quiet period of each quarterly financial release.\n \n3/4\n E. Priority of Statutory or Regulatory Trading Restrictions\nThe trading prohibitions and restrictions of this Rules will be superseded by any greater prohibitions or restrictions prescribed by securities\nlaws and regulations. Any employee, officer or Board Member who is uncertain whether other prohibitions or restrictions apply should ask\nthe Company’s General Counsel or CFO.\n \nIII. Reporting of Violations\nAny employee, officer or Board Member who violates this Rules or any laws governing insider trading or tipping, or knows of any such violation\nby any other employee, officer or Board Director, must report the violation immediately to the General Counsel of the Company. Upon learning of\nany such violation, the Company’s General Counsel will determine whether any action should be taken, including but not limited to whether the\nCompany should make public any Material Non-public Information, or whether the Company should report the violation to the appropriate\ngovernment authority.\n \nIV . Consequence of Insider Trading Violation\nAny TSMC employee, officer or Board Director knowingly violating this Rules shall be subject to disciplinary actions, including termination of\nemployment. Buying or selling TSMC securities or engaging in any derivatives or futures transactions involving TSMC securities on the basis of\nMaterial Non-public Information may also be subject to civil or criminal liabilities under the securities, derivatives or futures laws of Taiwan, the\nUnited States of America (as to ADRs) and other jurisdictions. A violation of the Company’s Rules is not necessarily the same as a violation of\nlaw. The Company reserves the right to determine, in its own discretion and on the basis of information available to it, whether the Rules has been\nviolated. The Company may determine that specific conduct violates the Rules, whether or not the conduct also violates the law. It is not necessary\nfor the Company to await the filing or conclusion of a civil or criminal action against the alleged violator before taking disciplinary action.\n \nV . Inquiries\nPlease direct all inquiries regarding any of the provisions or procedures of this Rules to the Company’s General Counsel.\n \n4/4\nExhibit 12.1\nCERTIFICATIONS\nI, C.C.

Below is a summary of the principal risks associated with an investment in our securities.\n• Our sales depend on a small number of customers. A reduction in orders from any of these customers, the loss of any of these customers, or acustomer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• Consolidation in the markets we serve could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• If the optical communications market does not expand as we expect, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which could adverselyimpact our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• Our quarterly revenues, gross profit margins and operating results have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future, which maycause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline or be volatile.\n• If we are unable to continue diversifying our precision optical and electro-mechanical manufacturing services across other markets within theoptics industry, such as the semiconductor processing, biotechnology, metrology and material processing markets, or if these markets do not growas fast as we expect, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operatingresults.\n• We face significant competition in our business. If we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, our business,financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\n• Cancellations, delays or reductions of customer orders and the relatively short-term nature of the commitments of our customers could harm ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\n• Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• We purchase some of the critical materials used in certain of our products from a single source or a limited number of suppliers.

Due to the inherent\nuncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates. In the event that the\nCompany's estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments will be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current\ninformation.\n10\nTable of Contents\nFiscal years\nThe Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday in June closest to June 30.

Fabrinet’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of\nassociation provide for indemnification of directors and officers for actions, costs, charges, losses, damages and expenses incurred in their capacities as\nsuch, except that such indemnification does not extend to any matter in respect of any fraud or dishonesty that may attach to any of them.\nIn accordance with Fabrinet’s form of indemnification agreement for its directors and officers, Fabrinet has agreed to indemnify its directors and\nofficers against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims by reason of their being such a director or officer.\nFabrinet maintains a director and officer liability insurance policy that may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid under the\nindemnification agreements.\nCredit facility agreement\nOn March 9, 2023, Fabrinet Thailand and the Parent Company (collectively, the “Borrowers”) and the Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited (the\n\"Bank\") entered into a credit facility agreement (the “2023 Credit Facility Agreement”), which provided a facility of $55.0 million.\nDuring the three months ended December 27, 2024, the Borrowers and the Bank amended the 2023 Credit Facility Agreement to reduce the facility to\n$30.0 million, which may be used for, among other things, an overdraft facility.\nAs of March 28, 2025, there was no amount outstanding under the 2023 Credit Facility Agreement.\nUnder the 2023 Credit Facility Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of less than or equal to 1.5 times for Fabrinet\nThailand and 1.0 times for the Parent Company.\nAs of March 28, 2025, the Borrowers were in compliance with all of their financial covenants under the 2023 Credit Facility Agreement.\nLitigation and claim\nOn June 28, 2024, Ngan In Leng and First Laser Limited (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint in the Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court\n(the “Court”) in Fuzhou, China against Fujian Enterprises (Holdings) Co., Ltd. (“FEHC”), Jian An Investment Limited (“Jian”), and Casix, Inc.\n(“Casix”), the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary located in the PRC. The complaint alleges unjust enrichment related to a purported investment in\nCasix by the Plaintiffs in 1997, which predates the Company's acquisition of Casix from JDS Uniphase Corporation. The Plaintiffs have requested that\nthe Court order FEHC to return the unjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs in the amount of RMB 400 million, with interest from March 1, 2000, and order\nJian and Casix to bear joint and several liability for all payment obligations of FEHC.\n26\nTable of Contents\nIn September 2024, the Court dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety based on jurisdictional grounds. The Plaintiffs have since appealed the Court’s ruling\nto the High People's Court of Fujian Province (the \"Appellate Court\"). In their appeal, the Plaintiffs now claim that Casix is the primary obligor to\nreturn the alleged unjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs. On November 24, 2024, the Appellate Court agreed to hear the appeal. At this time, the Company\nis not able to quantify any potential liability in connection with this litigation because of the early stage of this litigation.\n15.    Restructuring and other related costs\nIn January 2025, the Company implemented a restructuring initiative aimed at enhancing operational effectiveness and streamlining activities within\nits subsidiary located in Thailand. As a result of the restructuring, the Company incurred total charges of $1.3 million, which were primarily related to\nemployee severance and other termination benefits. These severance-related charges reflect the costs associated with workforce reductions across\nvarious functions within the Thailand operations.\nThe restructuring charges have been recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations within \"Restructuring and other related\ncharges\" for the three months ended March 28, 2025. The Company recognizes severance-related charges depending on whether the termination\nbenefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement. The Company recognizes the charges once the\nbenefits have been communicated to employees.\nAs of March 28, 2025, there was no restructuring liability balance.\n16.    Business segments and geographic information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nThe Company’s CODM is Fabrinet’s Chief Executive Officer.

Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. “We,” “us” or “our” collectively refer to Fabrinet and its subsidiaries.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nWe provide advanced optical packaging and precision optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing services to original equipment\nmanufacturers (“OEMs”) of complex products such as optical communication components, modules and sub-systems, industrial lasers, automotive\ncomponents, medical devices and sensors. We offer a broad range of advanced optical and electro-mechanical capabilities across the entire manufacturing\nprocess, including process design and engineering, supply chain management, manufacturing, complex printed circuit board assembly, advanced\npackaging, integration, final assembly and testing. We are capable of producing a wide variety of high complexity products in any mix and any volume.\nBased on our extensive experience and the positive feedback we have received from our customers, we believe we are a global leader in providing these\nservices to the optical communications, automotive, and industrial lasers markets.\nOur customer base includes companies in complex industries that require advanced precision manufacturing capabilities such as optical\ncommunications, automotive, industrial lasers, medical, and sensors. The products that we manufacture for our OEM customers include selective switching\nproducts; tunable lasers, transponders and transceivers; active optical cables; solid state, diode-pumped, gas and fiber lasers; and sensors. In many cases, we\nare the sole outsourced manufacturing partner used by our customers for the products that we manufacture for them.\nWe also design and fabricate application-specific crystals, lenses, prisms, mirrors, laser components, and substrates (collectively referred to as\n“customized optics”) and other custom and standard borosilicate, clear fused quartz, and synthetic fused silica glass products (collectively referred to as\n“customized glass”). We incorporate our customized optics and glass into many of the products we manufacture for our OEM customers, and we also sell\ncustomized optics and glass in the merchant market.\nRevenues\nWe believe we are able to expand our relationships with existing customers and attract new customers due to, among other factors, our broad range\nof complex engineering and manufacturing service offerings, flexible low-cost manufacturing platform, process optimization capabilities, advanced supply\nchain management, excellent customer service, and experienced management team. Although we expect the prices we charge for our manufactured\nproducts to decrease over time (partly as a result of competitive market forces), we believe we will be able to continue to maintain favorable pricing for our\nservices because of our ability to reduce cycle time, adjust our product mix by focusing on more complicated products, improve product quality and yields,\nand reduce material costs for the products we manufacture. We believe these capabilities have enabled us to help our OEM customers reduce their\nmanufacturing costs while maintaining or improving the design, quality, reliability, and delivery times for their products.\nRevenues by Geography\nWe generate revenues from three geographic regions: North America, Asia-Pacific and others, and Europe. Revenues are attributed to a particular\ngeographic area based on the bill-to location of our customers, notwithstanding that the products may be shipped to a different geographic region. The\nsubstantial majority of our revenues are derived from our manufacturing facilities in Asia-Pacific.\nThe percentage of our revenues generated from a bill-to location outside of North America decreased from 62.8% in the three months ended\nMarch 29, 2024 to 53.8% in the three months ended March 28, 2025, primarily because of an increase in revenue from a customer in the United States.\nThe percentage of our revenues generated from a bill-to location outside of North America decreased from 63.7% in the nine months ended\nMarch 29, 2024 to 56.8% in the nine months ended March 28, 2025, primarily because of an increase in revenue from a customer in the United States.\nBased on the short and medium-term indications and forecasts from our customers, we expect that the portion of our future revenues attributable to\ncustomers in regions outside North America for the remainder of fiscal year 2025 will be in line with the portion of revenues attributable to such customers\nduring the nine months ended March 28, 2025.\n29\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents percentages of total revenues by geographic region:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nMarch 28, 2025 March 29, 2024 March 28, 2025 March 29, 2024\nNorth America 46.2 % 37.2 % 43.2 % 36.3 %\nAsia-Pacific and others 45.9 57.0 49.0 57.2 \nEurope 7.9 5.8 7.8 6.5 \n100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nOur Contracts\nWe enter into supply agreements with our customers which generally have an initial term of up to three years, subject to automatic renewals for\nsubsequent one-year terms unless expressly terminated.

Although there are no minimum purchase requirements in our supply agreements, our customers\nprovide us with rolling forecasts of their demand requirements. Our supply agreements generally include provisions for pricing and periodic review of\npricing, consignment of our customer’s unique production equipment to us, and the sharing of benefits from cost-savings derived from our efforts. We are\ngenerally required to purchase materials, which may include long lead-time materials and materials that are subject to minimum order quantities and/or\nnon-cancelable or non-returnable terms, to meet the stated demands of our customers. After procuring materials, we manufacture products for our\ncustomers based on purchase orders that contain terms regarding product quantities, delivery locations and delivery dates. Our customers generally are\nobligated to purchase finished goods that we have manufactured according to their demand requirements. Materials that are not consumed by our customers\nwithin a specified period of time, or that are no longer required due to a product’s cancellation or end-of-life, are typically designated as excess or obsolete\ninventory under our contracts. Once materials are designated as either excess or obsolete inventory, our customers are typically required to purchase such\ninventory from us even if they have chosen to cancel production of the related products. The excess or obsolete inventory is shipped to the customer and\nrecognized as an offset against cost of revenue upon shipment.\nCost of Revenues\nThe key components of our cost of revenues are material costs, employee costs, and infrastructure-related costs. Material costs generally represent\nthe majority of our cost of revenues. Several of the materials we require to manufacture products for our customers are customized for their products and\noften sourced from a single supplier or in some cases, our own subsidiaries. Shortages from sole-source suppliers due to yield loss, quality concerns and\ncapacity constraints, among other factors, may increase our expenses and negatively impact our gross profit margin or total revenues in a given quarter.\nMaterial costs include scrap material. Historically, scrap rate diminishes during a product’s life cycle due to process, fixturing and test improvement and\noptimization.\nA second significant element of our cost of revenues is employee costs, including indirect employee costs related to design, configuration and\noptimization of manufacturing processes for our customers, quality testing, materials testing and other engineering services, and direct costs related to our\nmanufacturing employees. Direct employee costs include employee salaries, insurance and benefits, merit-based bonuses, recruitment, training and\nretention. Historically, our employee costs have increased primarily due to increases in the number of employees necessary to support our growth and, to a\nlesser extent, costs to recruit, train and retain employees. Our cost of revenues is significantly impacted by salary levels in Thailand and the PRC, the\nfluctuation of the Thai baht, and Chinese Renminbi (\"RMB\") against our functional currency, the U.S. dollar, and our ability to retain our employees. We\nexpect our employee costs to increase as wages continue to increase in Thailand and the PRC. Wage increases may impact our ability to sustain our\ncompetitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin. We seek to mitigate these cost increases through improvements in employee productivity,\nemployee retention and asset utilization.\nOur infrastructure costs are comprised of depreciation, utilities, facilities management and overhead costs. Most of our facility leases are long-term\nagreements. Our depreciation costs include buildings and fixed assets, primarily at our Pinehurst and Chonburi campuses in Thailand, and capital\nequipment located at each of our manufacturing locations.\nWe expect to incur incremental costs of revenue as a result of our planned expansion into new geographic markets, though we are not able to\ndetermine the amount of these incremental expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses primarily consist of corporate employee costs for sales and marketing, general and administrative and other support personnel,\nincluding research and development expenses related to the design of customized optics and glass, travel expenses, legal and other professional fees, share-\nbased compensation expense and other general expenses not related to\n30\nTable of Contents\ncost of revenues. In fiscal year 2025, we expect our SG&A expenses will increase compared with our fiscal year 2024 SG&A expenses, mainly due to\nincreases in employee costs, legal expenses and research and development (\"R&D\") expenses.\nThe compensation committee of our board of directors a"}

In fiscal year 2024, the compensation committee approved a fiscal year 2024 executive incentive plan\nwith quantitative objectives that were based solely on achieving certain revenue targets and non-GAAP operating margin targets for fiscal year 2024.\nAdditional Financial Disclosures\nForeign Exchange\nAs a result of our international operations, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, and primarily with\nrespect to the Thai baht. Although a majority of our total revenues is denominated in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of our payroll plus certain other\noperating expenses are incurred and paid in Thai baht. The exchange rate between the Thai baht and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated substantially in recent\nyears and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. We report our financial results in U.S. dollars and our results of operations have been and\ncould in the future be negatively impacted if the Thai baht appreciates against the U.S. dollar. Smaller portions of our expenses are incurred in a variety of\nother currencies, including RMB, GBP, Canadian dollars, Euros, and Japanese yen, the appreciation of which may also negatively impact our financial\nresults.\nIn order to manage the risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we use derivative instruments. We may enter into foreign\ncurrency exchange forward or put option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities and other forecasted\nforeign currency transactions and may designate these instruments as hedging instruments. The forward and put option contracts generally have maturities\nof up to 12 months. All foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Gains or\nlosses on our forward and put option contracts generally present gross amount in the assets, liabilities, and transactions economically hedged.\nWe had foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities in Thai baht, RMB and GBP as follows:\nAs of March 28, 2025 As of June 28, 2024\n(in thousands, except percentages) Foreign Currency $ %\nForeign Currency $ %\nAssets\nThai baht 1,145,359 33,796 80.9 % 1,046,000 28,385 72.5 %\nRMB 35,054 4,885 11.7 42,852 6,013 15.4 \nGBP 2,400 3,106 7.4 3,778 4,773 12.1 \nTotal $ 41,787 100.0 % $ 39,171 100.0 %\nLiabilities\nThai baht 4,087,353 120,606 91.5 % 3,263,391 88,559 87.4 %\nRMB 79,458 11,074 8.4 78,418 11,003 10.9 \nGBP 111 144 0.1 1,359 1,717 1.7 \nTotal $ 131,824 100.0 % $ 101,279 100.0 %\nThe Thai baht assets represent cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, deposits and other current assets.

We manage our exposure to\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates by the use of foreign currency contracts and offsetting assets and liabilities denominated in the same currency in\naccordance with management’s policy. As of March 28, 2025, there was $155.0 million of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding on the Thai baht\npayables.

However, conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct\ninvestments, loans, security investments and repatriation of investments, is still subject to the approval of SAFE.\nUnder the Administration Rules, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell, or remit foreign currencies at banks authorized to conduct foreign\nexchange business after providing valid commercial documents and relevant supporting documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions,\nobtaining approval from SAFE. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of the PRC are also subject to limitations, which include\napprovals by the Ministry of Commerce, SAFE and the State Development and Reform Commission. \nCircular 142 regulates the conversion by a foreign-invested company of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be\nused. Circular 142 requires that the registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies may only be used\nfor purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In\naddition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises settled in RMB converted from\nforeign currencies. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval and may not be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of\nsuch loans have not been used.\nOn January 5, 2007, SAFE promulgated the Detailed Rules for Implementing the Measures for the Administration on Individual Foreign Exchange,or the Implementation Rules. Under the Implementation Rules, PRC citizens who are granted share options by an overseas publicly-listed company arerequired, through a PRC agent or PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly-listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures.\nIn addition, the General Administration of Taxation has issued circulars concerning employee share options. Under these circulars, our employees\nworking in the PRC who exercise share options will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Our PRC subsidiary has obligations to file documents related\nto employee share options with relevant tax authorities and withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options.\nFurthermore, our transfer of funds to our subsidiaries in Thailand and the PRC are each subject to approval by governmental authorities in case of an\nincrease in registered capital, or subject to registration with governmental authorities in case of a shareholder loan. These limitations on the flow of funds\nbetween our subsidiaries and us could restrict our ability to act in response to changing market conditions.\n32\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax\nOur effective tax rate is a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. We are domiciled in the Cayman\nIslands. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to tax in the Cayman Islands on income or capital gains until March 6, 2039.\nThroughout the period of our operations in Thailand, we have generally received income tax and other incentives from the Thailand Board of\nInvestment. Preferential tax treatment from the Thai government in the form of a corporate tax exemption on income generated from projects to\nmanufacture certain products at our Chonburi campus is currently available to us through June 2026. Similar preferential tax treatment was available to us\nthrough June 2020 with respect to products manufactured at our Pinehurst campus Building 6.

After June 2020, 50% of our income generated from\nproducts manufactured at our Pinehurst campus will be exempted from tax through June 2025. Preferential tax treatment is available to us for products\nmanufactured at our Chonburi campus Building 9, where income generated will be tax exempt through 2031, capped at our actual investment amount. Such\npreferential tax treatment is contingent on various factors, including the export of our customers’ products out of Thailand and our agreement not to move\nour manufacturing facilities out of our current province in Thailand for at least 15 years from the date on which preferential tax treatment was granted.\nCurrently, the corporate income tax rate for our Thai subsidiary is 20%.\nAs of March 28, 2025, the corporate income tax rates for our subsidiaries in the PRC, the U.S., the U.K. and Israel are 25%, 21%, 25% and 23%,\nrespectively.\nOur deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that\nwill result in deductible and payable amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards. Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net\ndeferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to\nrealize these deferred income tax assets. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change depending on future market conditions, changes in U.S.\nor international tax laws, or other factors. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our\nvaluation allowance against the deferred tax assets, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nWe prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these\nestimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and on various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets\nand liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process,\nactual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We\nconsider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as their application\nplaces the most significant demands on our management’s judgment.\nOur critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2024. The adoption of new\naccounting policies and accounting standards are disclosed in Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no changes\nto our accounting policies.\n33\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

The increase was due to higher income subject to tax and a discrete expense related to continuing assessment of potential tax exposures during\nthe nine months ended March 28, 2025, offset by a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that was set up during the nine months ended March 29,\n2024 for our subsidiary in Israel.\nNet income\nWe recorded net income of $81.3 million, or 9.3% of revenues, for the three months ended March 28, 2025, compared with $80.9 million, or 11.1%\nof revenues, for the three months ended March 29, 2024.\nWe recorded net income of $245.3 million, or 9.8% of revenues, for the nine months ended March 28, 2025, compared with $215.1 million, or\n10.1% of revenues, for the nine months ended March 29, 2024.\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nWe recorded other comprehensive income of $6.2 million, or 0.7% of revenues, for the three months ended March 28, 2025, compared with other\ncomprehensive loss of $8.9 million, or 1.2% of revenues, for the three months ended March 29, 2024. The change was mainly due to (1) unrealized gain\nfrom mark-to-market of forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements of $9.1 million, (2) unrealized gain from mark-to-market of available-for-sale\ndebt securities of $5.1 million, and (3) an increase in unrealized gain from foreign currency translation adjustment of $1.0 million, offset by lower gain\nfrom a retirement benefits plan of $0.1 million.\nWe recorded other comprehensive income of $11.7 million, or 0.5% of revenues, for the nine months ended March 28, 2025, compared with other\ncomprehensive income of $3.5 million, or 0.2% of revenues, for the nine months ended March 29, 2024.

As of March 28, 2025, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-\nterm investments of $950.7 million and no outstanding debt. As of March 29, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of\n$794.0 million and outstanding debt of $3.0 million.\nOur cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of cash on hand, demand deposits, and liquid investments with original maturities of three\nmonths or less, are placed with banks and other financial institutions. The weighted-average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents was 4.1% and\n4.3% for the three and nine months ended March 28, 2025, respectively, and 4.5% and 4.3% for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2024,\nrespectively.\nOur cash investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the audit committee of our board of directors. In general, our\ninvestment policy requires that securities purchased be rated A1, P-1, F1 or better. No security may have an effective maturity that exceeds three years. Our\ninvestments in fixed income securities are primarily classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the\nspecific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) and are reported as a\nseparate component of shareholders’ equity.\nAs of March 29, 2024, we had long-term borrowing under our credit facility agreement of $3.0 million. As of March 28, 2025, we had no\noutstanding balance under our credit facility agreement. To better manage our cash on hand, we held short-term investments of $643.8 million as of\nMarch 28, 2025.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flow from operations, and funds available through our credit\nfacility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to sustain our working\ncapital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We also believe that our current\nmanufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our anticipated production requirements for at least the next few quarters. In February 2025, we began\nconstruction of a new manufacturing facility of approximately 2.0 million square feet at our Chonburi campus. The total expected cost of the project is\napproximately $132.5 million (Thai baht 4.45 billion).\nThe following table shows our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands) March 28, 2025 March 29, 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 273,272 $ 330,084 \nNet cash used in investing activities $ (253,126) $ (118,615)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (124,393) $ (57,800)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (104,247) $ 153,669 \nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. The decrease in\ncash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended March 28, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended March 29, 2024 was primarily\ndue to (1) a change in inventories of $133.6 million due to new products and higher sales volume, and (2) a decrease in other payables of $17.2 million,\noffset by (1) a change in other current and non-current assets of $31.2 million, (2) an increase in trade payables of $30.9 million, and (3) an increase in net\nincome of $30.2 million.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting cash flows consist primarily of investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and capital expenditures. The increase in cash used\nin investing activities for the nine months ended March 28, 2025 as compared to cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended March 29, 2024\nwas primarily due to an increase in investment purchases, and an increase in capital expenditures to support certain customers.\n38\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of repayment of long-term debt, share repurchases, and withholding tax related to net share settlement of\nrestricted share units.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $950.7 million and $858.6 million as of March 28, 2025 and June 28, 2024,\nrespectively. We have interest rate risk exposure relating to the interest income generated by excess cash invested in highly liquid investments with\nmaturities of three months or less from the original dates of purchase. The cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held for working capital\npurposes. We have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to\nmaterial risks due to changes in market interest rates. Declines in interest rates, however, will reduce future investment income. If overall interest rates had\ndeclined by 10 basis points during the nine months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, our interest income would have decreased by\napproximately $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, assuming consistent investment levels.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio in a variety of financial instruments, including, but not limited to, U.S. government and agency bonds,\ncorporate obligations, money market funds, asset-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities. The majority of these investments pay a fixed\nrate of interest. The securities in the investment portfolio are subject to market price risk due to changes in interest rates, perceived issuer creditworthiness,\nmarketability, and other factors. These investments are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our unaudited\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity.\nInvestments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market values of our fixed-\nrate securities decline if interest rates rise, while floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these\nfactors, our future investment income may be less than we expect because of changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell\nsecurities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAs a result of our foreign operations, we have significant expenses, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. Substantially all\nof our employees and most of our facilities are located in Thailand and the PRC. Therefore, a substantial portion of our payroll as well as certain other\noperating expenses are paid in Thai baht and RMB. The significant majority of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars because our customer\ncontracts generally provide that our customers will pay us in U.S. dollars.\nAs a consequence, our gross profit margins, operating results, profitability and cash flows are adversely impacted when the dollar depreciates\nrelative to the Thai baht or the RMB. We have a particularly significant currency rate exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the Thai baht, the\nRMB and the U.S. dollar. We must translate foreign currency-denominated results of operations, assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to U.S.\ndollars in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with\nsuch foreign currencies will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our unaudited condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets, even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency. These transactions could\nsignificantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities\nand shareholders’ equity.\nWe attempt to hedge against these exchange rate risks by entering into derivative instruments that are typically one to eighteen months in duration,\nleaving us exposed to longer term changes in exchange rates. Beginning December 28, 2019, we designated the foreign currency forward contracts used to\nhedge fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of forecasted transactions denominated in Thai baht as cash flow hedges, as they qualified for hedge accounting\nbecause the hedges are highly effective. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify as highly\neffective, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in our earnings. Any gains or losses related to these outstanding\nforeign currency forward contracts will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance\nsheets, with subsequent reclassification to the same statement of operations and comprehensive income line item as the earnings effect of hedge items when\nsettled. We recorded an unrealized gain of $0.6 million and unrealized loss of $0.8 million for the nine months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024,\nrespectively, related to derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments.

As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate relative to the U.S. dollar,\nwe expect to incur foreign currency translation adjustments and may incur foreign currency exchange losses. For example, a 10% weakening in the U.S.\ndollar against the Thai baht and the RMB would have resulted in a decrease in our net dollar position of approximately $10.0 million and $7.2 million as of\nMarch 28, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. We cannot give any assurance as to the effect that future changes in foreign currency rates will have on\nour unaudited condensed consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk refers to our exposures to financial institutions, suppliers and customers that have in the past and may in the future experience financial\ndifficulty, particularly in light of recent conditions in the credit markets and the global economy. As of March 28, 2025, our cash and cash equivalents were\nheld in deposits and highly liquid investment products with maturities of three months or less with banks and other financial institutions having credit\nratings of A minus or above. Our short-term investments as of March 28, 2025 are held in various financial institutions with a maturity limit not to exceed\nthree years, and all securities are rated A1, P-1, F1 or better. We continue to monitor our surplus cash and consider investment in corporate and U.S.\ngovernment debt as well as certain available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities in accordance with our investment policy. We generally monitor the\nfinancial performance of our suppliers and customers, as well as other factors that may affect their access to capital and liquidity. Presently, we believe that\nwe will not incur material losses due to our exposures to such credit risk.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period\ncovered by this Quarterly Report on Form10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we\nare required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within\nthe time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that the\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and\nchief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 28, 2025 that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n41\nTable of Contents\nPART II: OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn June 28, 2024, Ngan In Leng and First Laser Limited (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint in the Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court\n(the “Court”) in Fuzhou, China against Fujian Enterprises (Holdings) Co., Ltd. (“FEHC”), Jian An Investment Limited (“Jian”), and Casix, Inc. (“Casix”),\nour wholly-owned subsidiary located in the PRC. The complaint alleges unjust enrichment related to a purported investment in Casix by the Plaintiffs in\n1997, which predates our acquisition of Casix from JDS Uniphase Corporation. The Plaintiffs have requested that the Court order FEHC to return the\nunjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs in the amount of RMB 400 million, with interest from March 1, 2000, and order Jian and Casix to bear joint and several\nliability for all payment obligations of FEHC.\nIn September 2024, the Court dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety based on jurisdictional grounds. The Plaintiffs have since appealed the Court’s\nruling to the High People's Court of Fujian Province (the \"Appellate Court\"). In their appeal, the Plaintiffs now claim that Casix is the primary obligor to\nreturn the alleged unjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs. On November 24, 2024, the Appellate Court agreed to hear the appeal. At this time, we are not able to\nquantify any potential liability in connection with this litigation because of the early stage of this litigation.\nIn addition, we are from time to time s"}

The complaint alleges unjust enrichment related to a purported investment in Casix by the Plaintiffs in\n1997, which predates our acquisition of Casix from JDS Uniphase Corporation. The Plaintiffs have requested that the Court order FEHC to return the\nunjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs in the amount of RMB 400 million, with interest from March 1, 2000, and order Jian and Casix to bear joint and several\nliability for all payment obligations of FEHC.\nIn September 2024, the Court dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety based on jurisdictional grounds. The Plaintiffs have since appealed the Court’s\nruling to the High People's Court of Fujian Province (the \"Appellate Court\"). In their appeal, the Plaintiffs now claim that Casix is the primary obligor to\nreturn the alleged unjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs. On November 24, 2024, the Appellate Court agreed to hear the appeal. At this time, we are not able to\nquantify any potential liability in connection with this litigation because of the early stage of this litigation.\nIn addition, we are from time to time subject to, and are presently involved in, litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matter described\nabove, there are no pending lawsuits or claims that, individually or in the aggregate, may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or\noperating results. Our views and estimates related to these matters may change in the future, as new events and circumstances arise and as the matters\ncontinue to develop.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information\ncontained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before\ninvesting in our ordinary shares. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties of\nwhich we are unaware, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us or our ordinary shares. If any of the\nfollowing risks actually occur, they may harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In this event, the market price of our ordinary shares\ncould decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nCompany and Operational Risks\nOur sales depend on a small number of customers. A reduction in orders from any of these customers, the loss of any of these customers, or a\ncustomer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have depended, and will continue to depend, upon a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues. During the three\nmonths ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, we had three customers and two customers, respectively, that each contributed 10% or more of our\nrevenues. Such customers together accounted for 52.2% and 52.5% of our revenues during the respective periods. During the nine months ended March 28,\n2025 and March 29, 2024, we had two customers and three customers, respectively, that each contributed 10% or more of our revenues. Such customers\ntogether accounted for 47.5% and 56.4% of our revenues during the respective periods. Dependence on a small number of customers means that a reduction\nin orders from, a loss of, or other adverse actions by any one of these customers would reduce our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, our customer concentration increases the concentration of our accounts receivable and our exposure to payment default by any of our key\ncustomers. Many of our existing and potential customers have substantial debt burdens, have experienced financial distress or have static or declining\nrevenues, all of which may be exacerbated by the current global economic downturn and subsequent adverse conditions in the credit markets, as well as the\nimpact of changes to U.S. and international trade policies. Certain of our customers have gone out of business, declared bankruptcy, been acquired, or\nannounced their withdrawal from segments of the optics market. We generate significant accounts payable and inventory for the services that we provide to\nour customers, which could expose us to substantial and potentially unrecoverable costs if we do not receive payment from our customers.\nOur reliance on a small number of customers gives our customers substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contracts with us. In\naddition, although we enter into master supply agreements with our customers, the level of business to be transacted under those agreements is not\nguaranteed. Instead, we are awarded business under those agreements\n42\nTable of Contents\non a project-by-project basis. Some of our customers have at times significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services that they order\nfrom us. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our existing significant customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could\nbe harmed.\nConsolidation in the markets we serve could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nConsolidation in the markets we serve has resulted in a reduction in the number of potential customers for our services. For example, Nokia\nCorporation completed its acquisition of Infinera Corporation in February 2025; Lumentum Holdings Inc. completed its acquisition of NeoPhotonics\nCorporation in August 2022; Coherent Corp. (formerly known as II-VI Incorporated) completed its acquisition of Coherent, Inc. in July "}

For example, Nokia\nCorporation completed its acquisition of Infinera Corporation in February 2025; Lumentum Holdings Inc. completed its acquisition of NeoPhotonics\nCorporation in August 2022; Coherent Corp. (formerly known as II-VI Incorporated) completed its acquisition of Coherent, Inc. in July 2022; and Cisco\nSystems, Inc. completed its acquisition of Acacia Communications, Inc. in March 2021. In some cases, consolidation among our customers has led to a\nreduction in demand for our services as customers have acquired the capacity to manufacture products in-house.\nConsolidation among our customers and their customers will continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results in\nseveral ways. Consolidation among our customers and their customers may result in a smaller number of large customers whose size and purchasing power\ngive them increased leverage that may result in, among other things, decreases in our average selling prices. In addition to pricing pressures, this\nconsolidation may also reduce overall demand for our manufacturing services if customers obtain new capacity to manufacture products in-house or\ndiscontinue duplicate or competing product lines in order to streamline operations. If demand for our manufacturing services decreases, our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nIf the optical communications market does not expand as we expect, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which could adversely\nimpact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRevenues from optical communications products represented 75.4% and 80.9% of our revenues for the three months ended March 28, 2025 and\nMarch 29, 2024, respectively. Our future success as a provider of precision optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing services for the optical\ncommunications market depends on the continued growth of the optics industry and, in particular, the continued expansion of global information networks,\nparticularly those directly or indirectly dependent upon a fiber optic infrastructure. As part of that growth, we anticipate that demand for voice, video, and\nother data services delivered over high-speed connections (both wired and wireless) will continue to increase. Without network and bandwidth growth, the\nneed for enhanced communications products would be jeopardized. Currently, demand for network services and for high-speed broadband access, in\nparticular, is increasing but growth may be limited by several factors, including, among others: (1) relative strength or weakness of the global economy or\nthe economy in certain countries or regions, (2) an uncertain regulatory environment, and (3) uncertainty regarding long-term sustainable business models\nas multiple industries, such as the cable, traditional telecommunications, wireless and satellite industries, offer competing content delivery solutions. The\noptical communications market also has experienced periods of overcapacity, some of which have occurred even during periods of relatively high network\nusage and bandwidth demands. If the factors described above were to slow, stop or reverse the expansion in the optical communications market, our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results would be negatively affected.\nOur quarterly revenues, gross profit margins and operating results have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future, which\nmay cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline or be volatile.\nOur quarterly revenues, gross profit margins, and operating results have fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the\nfuture. For example, any of the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and, in particular, the following factors, could cause our revenues, gross profit\nmargins, and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter:\n• any reduction in customer demand or our ability to fulfill customer orders as a result of disruptions in our supply chain;\n• our ability to acquire new customers and retain our existing customers;\n• the cyclicality of the optical communications, automotive, industrial lasers, medical and sensors markets;\n• competition;\n• our ability to achieve favorable pricing for our services;\n• the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n• our ability to manage our headcount and other costs; and\n• changes in the relative mix in our revenues.\n43\nTable of Contents\nTherefore, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be useful in predicting our future operating results. You\nshould not rely on our results for one quarter as any indication of our future performance. Quarterly variations in our operations could result in significant\nvolatility in the market price of our ordinary shares.\nIf we are unable to continue diversifying our precision optical and electro-mechanical manufacturing services across other markets within the\noptics industry, such as the semiconductor processing, biotechnology, metrology and material p"}

Quarterly variations in our operations could result in significant\nvolatility in the market price of our ordinary shares.\nIf we are unable to continue diversifying our precision optical and electro-mechanical manufacturing services across other markets within the\noptics industry, such as the semiconductor processing, biotechnology, metrology and material processing markets, or if these markets do not grow as\nfast as we expect, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe intend to continue diversifying across other markets within the optics industry, such as the semiconductor processing, biotechnology, metrology,\nand material processing markets, to reduce our dependence on the optical communications market and to grow our business. Currently, the optical\ncommunications market contributes the significant majority of our revenues. There can be no assurance that our efforts to further expand and diversify into\nother markets within the optics industry will prove successful or that these markets will continue to grow as fast as we expect. If the opportunities presented\nby these markets prove to be less than anticipated, if we are less successful than expected in diversifying into these markets, or if our margins in these\nmarkets prove to be less than expected, our growth may slow or stall, and we may incur costs that are not offset by revenues in these markets, all of which\ncould harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face significant competition in our business. If we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nOur current and prospective customers tend to evaluate our capabilities against the merits of their internal manufacturing as well as the capabilities\nof other third-party manufacturers. We believe the internal manufacturing capabilities of current and prospective customers are our primary competition.\nThis competition is particularly strong when our customers have excess manufacturing capacity, as was the case when the markets that we serve\nexperienced a significant downturn in 2008 and 2009 that resulted in underutilized capacity. Should our existing and potential customers have excess\nmanufacturing capacity at their facilities, it could adversely affect our business. In addition, as a result of the 2011 flooding in Thailand, some of our\ncustomers began manufacturing products internally or using other third-party manufacturers that were not affected by the flooding. If our customers choose\nto manufacture products internally rather than to outsource production to us, or choose to outsource to a different third-party manufacturer, our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nCompetitors in the market for optical manufacturing services include Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Celestica Inc., Sanmina-SCI Corporation, Jabil\nCircuit, Inc., Venture Corporation Limited, and InnoLight Technology (Suzhou) Ltd. Our customized optics and glass operations face competition from\ncompanies such as Fujian Castech Crystals, Inc., Photop Technologies, Inc., and Research Electro-Optic, Inc. Other existing contract manufacturing\ncompanies, original design manufacturers or outsourced semiconductor assembly and test companies could also enter our target markets. In addition, we\nmay face new competitors as we attempt to penetrate new markets.\nMany of our customers and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly\ngreater resources than we have. These advantages may allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of service\nofferings that are similar or superior to our service offerings. These competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development, undertake\nmore far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or offer services that achieve greater market acceptance than ours. These\ncompetitors may also compete with us by making more attractive offers to our existing and potential employees, suppliers, and strategic partners. Further,\nconsolidation in the optics industry could lead to larger and more geographically diverse competitors. New and increased competition could result in price\nreductions for our services, reduced gross profit margins or loss of market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future\ncompetitors, and the competitive pressures we face may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCancellations, delays or reductions of customer orders and the relatively short-term nature of the commitments of our customers could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nWe do not typically obtain firm purchase orders or commitments from our customers that extend beyond 13 weeks.

While we work closely with our\ncustomers to develop forecasts for periods of up to one year, these forecasts are not binding and may be unreliable. Customers may cancel their orders,\nchange production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production for a number of reasons beyond our control. Any material delay, cancellation or\nreduction of orders could cause our revenues to decline significantly and could cause us to hold excess materials. Many of our costs and operating expenses\nare fixed. As a result, a reduction in customer demand could decrease our gross profit and harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we make significant decisions with respect to production schedules, material procurement commitments, personnel needs and other\nresource requirements based on our estimate of our customers’ requirements. The short-term nature of our customers’ commitments and the possibility of\nrapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers. Inability to forecast the level\nof customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to allocate resources to specific customers, order appropriate levels of materials and maximize the use\nof our manufacturing capacity. This could also lead to an inability to meet a spike in production demand, all of which could harm our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nOur exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSome of our customers and suppliers have in the past and may in the future experience financial difficulty, particularly in light of adverse conditions\nin the credit markets that have affected access to capital and liquidity. During challenging economic times, our customers may face difficulties in gaining\ntimely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us. As a result, we devote significant resources to monitor\nreceivables and inventory balances with certain of our customers. If our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering\namounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our services from these customers could decline. If our suppliers experience financial difficulty,\nwe could have trouble sourcing materials necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments. Any such financial difficulty could\nadversely affect our operating results and financial condition by resulting in a reduction in our revenues, a charge for inventory write-offs, a provision for\nexpected credit losses, and larger working capital requirements due to increased days in inventory and days in accounts receivable.\nWe purchase some of the critical materials used in certain of our products from a single source or a limited number of suppliers. Supply\nshortages have in the past, and could in the future, impair the quality, reduce the availability or increase the cost of materials, which could harm our\nrevenues, profitability and customer relations.\nWe rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers for critical materials used in a significant number of the products we manufacture. We\ngenerally purchase these single or limited source materials through standard purchase orders and do not maintain long-term supply agreements with our\nsuppliers. We generally use a rolling 12-month forecast based on anticipated product orders, customer forecasts, product order history, backlog, and\nwarranty and service demand to determine our materials requirements. Lead times for the parts and components that we order vary significantly and depend\non factors such as manufacturing cycle times, manufacturing yields, and the availability of raw materials used to produce the parts or components.\nHistorically, we have experienced supply shortages resulting from various causes, including reduced yields by our suppliers, which prevented us from\nmanufacturing products for our customers in a timely manner. The semiconductor supply chain is complex, and, in recent years, there has been a significant\nglobal shortage of semiconductors. Demand for consumer electronics surged during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains strong, which in turn has\nincreased the demand for semiconductors. At the same time, wafer foundries that support chipmakers have not invested enough in recent years to increase\ncapacities to the levels needed to support the increased demand from all of their customers. Further exacerbating the shortage is the long production lead-\ntime for wafers, which can be as long as 30 weeks in some cases. A shortage of semiconductors or other key components can cause a significant disruption\nto our production schedule and have a substantial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur revenues, pr"}

A shortage of semiconductors or other key components can cause a significant disruption\nto our production schedule and have a substantial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur revenues, profitability and customer relations will be harmed by continued fluctuations in the availability of materials, a stoppage or delay of\nsupply, a substitution of more expensive or less reliable parts, the receipt of defective parts or contaminated materials, an increase in the price of supplies,\nor an inability to obtain reductions in price from our suppliers in response to competitive pressures. We continue to undertake programs to strengthen our\nsupply chain. Nevertheless, we are experiencing, and expect for the foreseeable future to experience, strain on our supply chain, as well as periodic supplier\n45\nTable of Contents\nproblems. These supply chain issues have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we have incurred, and expect\nfor the foreseeable future to incur, increased costs related to our efforts to address these problems.\nManaging our inventory is complex and may require write-downs due to excess or obsolete inventory, which could cause our operating results to\ndecrease significantly in a given fiscal period.\nManaging our inventory is complex. We are generally required to procure materials based upon the anticipated demand of our customers. The\ninaccuracy of these forecasts or estimates could result in excess supply or shortages of certain materials. Inventory that is not used or expected to be used as\nand when planned may become excess or obsolete. Generally, we are unable to use most of the materials purchased for one of our customers to\nmanufacture products for any of our other customers. Additionally, we could experience reduced or delayed product shipments or incur additional\ninventory write-downs and cancellation charges or penalties, which would increase costs and could harm our business, financial condition and operating\nresults. While our agreements with customers are structured to mitigate our risks related to excess or obsolete inventory, enforcement of these provisions\nmay result in material expense, and delay in payment for inventory. If any of our significant customers becomes unable or unwilling to purchase inventory\nor does not agree to such contractual provisions in the future, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nIf we fail to adequately expand our manufacturing capacity, we will not be able to grow our business, which would harm our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. Conversely, if we expand too much or too rapidly, we may experience excess capacity, which would harm our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to pursue many large customer orders or sustain our historical growth rates if we do not have sufficient manufacturing capacity\nto enable us to commit to provide customers with specified quantities of products. If our customers do not believe that we have sufficient manufacturing\ncapacity, they may: (1) outsource all of their production to another manufacturer that they believe can fulfill all of their production requirements; (2) look to\na second manufacturer for the manufacture of additional quantities of the products that we currently manufacture for them; (3) manufacture the products\nthemselves; or (4) decide against using our services for their new products.\nWe most recently expanded our manufacturing capacity by building a new facility at our Chonburi campus in Thailand in 2022, and we began\nconstruction of a new manufacturing building at our Chonburi campus in February 2025. We may continue to devote significant resources to the expansion\nof our manufacturing capacity, and any such expansion will be expensive, will require management’s time and may disrupt our operations. In the event we\nare unsuccessful in our attempts to expand our manufacturing capacity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nHowever, if we successfully expand our manufacturing capacity but are unable to promptly utilize the additional space due to reduced demand for\nour services or an inability to win new projects, add new customers or penetrate new markets, or if the optics industry does not grow as we expect, we may\nexperience periods of excess capacity, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may experience manufacturing yields that are lower than expected, potentially resulting in increased costs, which could harm our business,\noperating results and customer relations.\nManufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n• the quality of input, materials and equipment;\n• the quality and feasibility of our customer’s design;\n• the repeatability and complexity of the manufacturing process;\n• the experience and quality of training of our manufacturing and engineering teams; and\n• "}

Manufacturing yields and margins can also be lower\nif we receive or inadvertently use defective or contaminated materials from our suppliers. In addition, our customer contracts typically provide that we will\nsupply products at a fixed price each quarter, which assumes specific production yields and quality metrics. If we do not meet the yield assumptions and\nquality metrics used in calculating the price of a product, we may not be able to recover the costs associated with our failure to do so. Consequently, our\noperating results and profitability may be harmed.\n46\nTable of Contents\nIf the products that we manufacture contain defects, we could incur significant correction costs, demand for our services may decline and we\nmay be exposed to product liability and product warranty claims, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and customer\nrelations.\nWe manufacture products to our customers’ specifications, and our manufacturing processes and facilities must comply with applicable statutory and\nregulatory requirements. In addition, our customers’ products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them are often complex. As a result,\nproducts that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or fail to be\nin compliance with applicable statutory or regulatory requirements. Additionally, not all defects are immediately detectable. The testing procedures of our\ncustomers are generally limited to the evaluation of the products that we manufacture under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons\n(including, among others, the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable at the time of testing or that are detected only when products are\nfully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions), these products may fail to perform as expected after their initial acceptance by a customer.\nWe generally provide a warranty of between one to five years on the products that we manufacture for our customers. This warranty typically\nguarantees that products will conform to our customers’ specifications and be free from defects in workmanship. Defects in the products we manufacture,\nwhether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or by deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, and whether such defects\nare discovered during or after the warranty period, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation, whether or\nnot we are indemnified for such failures. We could also incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when\nsuch failures occur in installed systems. In some instances, we may also be required to incur costs to repair or replace defective products outside of the\nwarranty period in the event that a recurring defect is discovered in a certain percentage of a customer’s products delivered over an agreed upon period of\ntime. We have experienced product or component failures in the past and remain exposed to such failures, as the products that we manufacture are widely\ndeployed throughout the world in multiple environments and applications. Further, due to the difficulty in determining whether a given defect resulted from\nour customer’s design of the product or our manufacturing process, we may be exposed to product liability or product warranty claims arising from defects\nthat are not attributable to our manufacturing process. In addition, if the number or type of defects exceeds certain percentage limitations contained in our\ncontractual arrangements, we may be required to conduct extensive failure analysis, re-qualify for production or cease production of the specified products.\nProduct liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage. Product warranty claims may include liability for a recall,\nrepair or replacement of a product or component. Although liability for these claims is generally assigned to our customers in our contracts, even where\nthey have assumed liability our customers may not, or may not have the resources to, satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product.\nAdditionally, under one of our contracts, in the event the products we manufacture do not meet the end-customer’s testing requirements or otherwise fail,\nwe may be required to pay penalties to our customer, including a fee during the time period that the customer or end-customer’s production line is not\noperational as a result of the failure of the products that we manufacture, all of which cou"}

Although liability for these claims is generally assigned to our customers in our contracts, even where\nthey have assumed liability our customers may not, or may not have the resources to, satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product.\nAdditionally, under one of our contracts, in the event the products we manufacture do not meet the end-customer’s testing requirements or otherwise fail,\nwe may be required to pay penalties to our customer, including a fee during the time period that the customer or end-customer’s production line is not\noperational as a result of the failure of the products that we manufacture, all of which could harm our business, operating results and customer relations. If\nwe engineer or manufacture a product that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could incur\nsignificant costs to resolve the claim. While we maintain insurance for certain product liability claims, we do not maintain insurance for any recalls and,\ntherefore, would be required to pay any associated costs that are determined to be our responsibility. A successful product liability or product warranty\nclaim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited, is not available or has not been obtained\ncould harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to attract additional skilled employees or retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract additional skilled employees and retain our current key personnel. We have identified\nseveral areas where we intend to expand our hiring, including business development, finance, human resources, operations and supply chain management.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Our future also\ndepends on the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key management and technical personnel, each of whom would be\ndifficult to replace. Although we have key person life insurance policies on some of our executive officers, the loss of any of our executive officers or key\npersonnel or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n47\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in governmental policies regarding foreign currencies could increase our\noperating costs, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nVolatility in the functional and non-functional currencies of our entities and the U.S. dollar could seriously harm our business, financial condition\nand operating results. The primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on our cash, receivables, and payables of our operating entities. We may\nexperience significant unexpected losses from fluctuations in exchange rates. For example, in the three months ended September 27, 2024, we experienced\na $7.1 million foreign exchange loss, which negatively affected our net income per share for the same period by $0.19.\nOur customer contracts generally require that our customers pay us in U.S. dollars. However, the majority of our payroll and other operating\nexpenses are paid in Thai baht. As a result of these arrangements, we have significant exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the Thai baht and\nthe U.S. dollar, and our operating results are adversely impacted when the U.S. dollar depreciates relative to the Thai baht and other currencies. As of\nMarch 28, 2025, the U.S. dollar had depreciated approximately 0.6% against the Thai baht since March 31, 2023. While we attempt to hedge against\ncertain exchange rate risks, we typically enter into hedging contracts with maturities of up to 12 months, leaving us exposed to longer term changes in\nexchange rates.\nAdditionally, we have significant exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) and the U.S. dollar. The\nexpenses of our subsidiaries located in the PRC are denominated in RMB. Currently, RMB are convertible in connection with trade and service-related\nforeign exchange transactions, foreign debt service, and payment of dividends. The PRC government may at its discretion restrict access in the future to\nforeign currencies for current account transactions. If this occurs, our PRC subsidiary may not be able to pay us dividends in U.S. dollars without prior\napproval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange. In addition, conversion of RMB for most capital account items, including direct\ninvestments, is still subject to government approval in the PRC. This restriction may limit our ability to invest the earnings of our PRC subsidiary. As of\nMarch 28, 2025, the U.S. dollar had appreciated approximately 6.1% against the RMB since March 31, 2023. There remains significant international\npressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantially more liberalized currency policy. Any appreciation in the value of the RMB against the U.S.\ndollar could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe conduct operations in a number of countries, which creates logistical and communications challenges for us and exposes us to other risks\nand challenges that co"}

There remains significant international\npressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantially more liberalized currency policy. Any appreciation in the value of the RMB against the U.S.\ndollar could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe conduct operations in a number of countries, which creates logistical and communications challenges for us and exposes us to other risks\nand challenges that could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe vast majority of our operations, including manufacturing and customer support, are located primarily in the Asia- Pacific region. The distances\nbetween Thailand, the PRC and our customers and suppliers globally create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us, including\nmanaging operations across multiple time zones, directing the manufacture and delivery of products across significant distances, coordinating the\nprocurement of raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations and coordinating the activities and decisions of our management team, the members\nof which are based in different countries.\nOur customers are located throughout the world, and our principal manufacturing facilities are located in Thailand. Revenues from the bill-to-\nlocation of customers outside of North America accounted for 53.8% and 62.8% of our revenues for the three months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29,\n2024, respectively. We expect that revenues from the bill-to-location of customers outside of North America will continue to account for a significant\nportion of our revenues. Our customers also depend on international sales, which further exposes us to the risks associated with international operations.\nConducting business outside the United States subjects us to a number of risks and challenges, including:\n• compliance with a variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including trade regulatory requirements;\n• periodic changes in a specific country or region’s economic conditions, such as recession;\n• unanticipated restrictions on our ability to sell to foreign customers where sales of products and the provision of services may require export\nlicenses or are prohibited by government action (for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has prohibited the export and sale of a broad\ncategory of U.S. products, as well as the provision of services, to ZTE Corporation and to Huawei, both of which are customers of certain of\nour customers);\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n• inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n48\nTable of Contents\n• political, legal and economic instability, foreign armed conflicts (such as the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war), and the impact\nof regional and global infectious illnesses in the countries in which we and our customers and suppliers are located.\nOur failure to manage the risks and challenges associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls in several jurisdictions that subject us to a variety of risks, including liability,\nimpairment of our ability to compete in international markets, and decreased sales and customer orders.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls in Thailand, the PRC, Israel and the United States that may limit our business\nopportunities. Various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws or taken actions that could limit (1) our ability to export\nor sell the products we manufacture and (2) our customers’ ability to export or sell products that we manufacture for them. The export of certain\ntechnologies from the United States and other nations to the PRC is barred by applicable export controls, and similar prohibitions could be extended to\nThailand, thereby limiting our ability to manufacture certain products. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to\nthe enforcement of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could limit our ability to offer our\nmanufacturing services to existing or potential customers, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFor example, the May 2019 addition of Huawei and certain affiliates by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (\"BIS\")\nto the BIS Entity List denied Huawei the ability to purchase products, software and technology that are subject to U.S. Export Administration Regulations.\nAlthough we do not sell directly to Huawei, some of our customers do sell to Huawei (and its affiliates) directly. To ensure compliance, some of our\ncustomers immediately suspended shipments to Huawei in order to assess whether their products were subject to the restrictions resulting from the ban.\nThis had an immediate impact on our customer orders in the three months ended June 28, 2019, which affected our revenue for that quarter. We expect this\nban to continue to adversely affect orders from our customers for the foreseeable future.\nWe are subject to risks related to changes in U.S. and interna"}

We expect this\nban to continue to adversely affect orders from our customers for the foreseeable future.\nWe are subject to risks related to changes in U.S. and international trade policies, including new or increased tariffs on materials that we use in\nmanufacturing, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn April 2025, the U.S. imposed global trade tariffs on a wide range of products and goods. Our business may be adversely affected by evolving\nglobal trade policies, including tariffs and other trade restrictions. We are subject to risks associated with changes in international trade policies,\nregulations, and relationships. In recent years, multiple countries, including the United States, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and members of the\nEuropean Union, among others have enacted tariffs, export controls, quotas, and other forms of trade restrictions on a variety of goods and services. These\nmeasures have led to increased costs, supply chain disruptions, and reduced demand across several industries. Although certain tariffs have been reduced or\ndelayed, the potential for future escalation or the imposition of new trade restrictions remains. Ongoing or future trade disputes may impact the availability\nand cost of materials used in our manufacturing processes. In some cases, suppliers may struggle to meet increased demand resulting from accelerated\npurchasing ahead of anticipated policy changes, further exacerbating supply chain instability. Additionally, retaliatory actions or changes in trade policies\nby foreign governments may reduce the demand for our customers’ products in impacted regions, which could lead to reduced orders and revenue for us. If\nwe are unable to mitigate the effects of increased costs or pass them on to our customers, our gross margins, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of current or future trade negotiations, the timing of any policy changes, or the impact such changes may have on our\nindustry, supply chain, or customer base.\nPolitical unrest and demonstrations, as well as changes in the political, social, business or economic conditions in Thailand, could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nThe majority of our assets and manufacturing operations are located in Thailand. Therefore, political, social, business and economic conditions in\nThailand have a significant effect on our business. Any changes to tax regimes, laws, exchange controls or political action in Thailand may harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nThailand has a history of political unrest that includes the involvement of the military as an active participant in the ruling government. In recent\nyears, political unrest in the country has sparked political demonstrations and, in some instances, violence. Any future political instability in Thailand could\nprevent shipments from entering or leaving the country, disrupt our\n49\nTable of Contents\nability to manufacture products in Thailand, and force us to transfer our operations to more stable, and potentially more costly, regions, which would harm\nour business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, the Thai government may raise the minimum wage standards for labor and could repeal certain promotional certificates that we have\nreceived or tax holidays for certain export and value added taxes that we enjoy, either preventing us from engaging in our current or anticipated activities or\nsubjecting us to higher tax rates.\nWe expect to continue to invest in our manufacturing operations in the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\"), which will continue to expose us to\nrisks inherent in doing business in the PRC, any of which risks could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to invest in our customized optics manufacturing facilities located in Fuzhou, the PRC. Because these operations\nare located in the PRC, they are subject to greater political, legal and economic risks than the geographies in which the facilities of many of our competitors\nand customers are located. In particular, the political and economic climate in the PRC (both at national and regional levels) is fluid and unpredictable. A\nlarge part of the PRC’s economy is still being operated under varying degrees of control by the PRC government. By imposing industrial policies and other\neconomic measures, such as control of foreign exchange, taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, intellectual\nproperty and restrictions on foreign participation in the domestic market of various industries, the PRC government exerts considerable direct and indirect\ninfluence on the development of the PRC economy.

Many of the economic reforms carried out by the PRC government are unprecedented or experimental\nand are expected to change further. Any changes to the political, legal or economic climate in the PRC could harm our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nOur PRC subsidiary is a “wholly foreign-owned enterprise” and is therefore subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in the\nPRC, in general, and laws and regulations applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises, in particular. The PRC has made significant progress in the\npromulgation of laws and regulations pertaining to economic matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce,\ntaxation and trade. However, the promulgation of new laws, changes in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may have a\nnegative impact on our business and prospects. In addition, these laws and regulations are relatively new, and published cases are limited in volume and\nnon-binding. Therefore, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. Laws may be changed with little\nor no prior notice, for political or other reasons. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to foreign investors. Furthermore, any\nlitigation in the PRC may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management’s attention.\nNatural disasters, epidemics, acts of terrorism and political and economic developments could harm our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our manufacturing operations and increase our supply chain costs. These events, over which we have little or\nno control, could cause a decrease in demand for our services, make it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture and deliver products or for our suppliers\nto deliver components allowing us to manufacture those products, require large expenditures to repair or replace our facilities, or create delays and\ninefficiencies in our supply chain. For example, the 2011 flooding in Thailand forced us to temporarily shut down all of our manufacturing facilities in\nThailand and cease production permanently at our former Chokchai facility, which adversely affected our ability to meet our customers’ demands during\nfiscal year 2012.\nIn some countries in which we operate, including the PRC, the U.S., and Thailand, outbreaks of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, H1N1\ninfluenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome or bird flu could disrupt our manufacturing operations, reduce demand for our customers’ products and\nincrease our supply chain costs. For example, the outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a two-week suspension of operations at our facility in Fuzhou, the\nPRC in February 2020 and caused labor shortages for us and some of our suppliers and customers in the PRC during the three months ended March 27,\n2020, which negatively affected our revenues during the same period.\nIn addition, increased international political instability, the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks, conflicts in the Middle East, Asia and Europe\n(including the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war), strained international relations arising from these conflicts and the related decline in\nconsumer confidence and economic weakness, may hinder our ability to do business. Any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt\nour operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed for our manufacturing services. Such\nevents may also disrupt the transportation of materials to our manufacturing facilities and finished products to our customers. These events have had, and\nmay continue to have, an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general, and customer confidence\n50\nTable of Contents\nand spending in particular, which in turn could adversely affect our total revenues and operating results. The impact of these events on the volatility of the\nU.S. and world financial markets also could increase the volatility of the market price of our ordinary shares and may limit the capital resources available to\nus, our customers and our suppliers.\nFinancial Risks\nUnfavorable worldwide economic conditions (including inflation and supply chain disruptions) may negatively affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nThe current volatility and adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets have negatively affected levels of business and consumer spending,\nheightening concerns about the likelihood of a global recession and potential default of various national bonds and debt backed by individual countries.\nSuch developments, as well as the policies impacting these, could adversely affect our financial results.

In particular, the economic disruption caused by\nCOVID-19 has led to reduced demand in some of our customers’ optical communications product portfolios and significant volatility in global stock\nmarkets and currency exchange rates. Uncertainty about worldwide economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may further reduce or postpone\nspending in response to reduced budgets, tight credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results and increase the volatility of our share price. In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be\nrestricted, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions and could also adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nIn 2022 and 2023, inflation increased globally to levels not seen in decades. Although inflation rates have recently declined, inflation can adversely\naffect us by increasing the costs of labor and other expenses. There is no assurance that our revenues will increase at the same rate to maintain the same\nlevel of profitability. Inflation and government efforts to combat inflation, such as raising the benchmark interest rate, could increase market volatility and\nhave an adverse effect on the financial market and global economy. In addition, we expect that disruptions in our supply chain and fluctuations in the\navailability of parts and materials will continue to have a significant impact on our ability to generate revenue, despite strong demand from our customers.\nSuch adverse conditions could negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our shareholders.\nWe anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operating activities and funds available through our\nworking capital and credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes for at least the next 12\nmonths. However, we operate in a market that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate. It is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs. If this occurs, we may need additional financing to execute on our\ncurrent or future business strategies.\nFurthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders\ncould be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. If\nadequate additional funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage\nof unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our manufacturing services, hire additional technical and other personnel, or otherwise respond to\ncompetitive pressures could be significantly limited.\nOur investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets.\nWe use professional investment management firms to manage our excess cash and cash equivalents. Our short-term investments as of March 28,\n2025 are primarily investments in a fixed income portfolio, including liquidity funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits, corporate debt securities, and\nU.S. agency and U.S. Treasury securities. Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets. We follow an established\ninvestment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality\nstandards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. The policy also provides that we may not\ninvest in short-term investments with a maturity in excess of three years.\nShould financial market conditions worsen, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit\nconcerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and\n51\nTable of Contents\nexpense to vary from expectations. As of March 28, 2025, we did not record any impairment charges associated with our portfolio of short-term\ninvestments, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or\nmarket liquidity, or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.\nW"}

Natural disasters or other catastrophes could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nOur current property and casualty insurance covers loss or damage to our property and third-party property over which we have custody and control,\nas well as losses associated with business interruption, subject to specified exclusions and limitations such as coinsurance, facilities location sub-limits and\nother policy limitations and covenants. Even with insurance coverage, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including acts of war, could cause us to\nsuffer substantial losses in our operational capacity and could also lead to a loss of opportunity and to a potential adverse impact on our relationships with\nour existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them, for which we might not be compensated by existing insurance. This in\nturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported\namounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are\ninherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,\nexpenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIntellectual Property and Cybersecurity Risks\nOur business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure and/or cyber\nsecurity attacks.\nWe rely upon the capacity, availability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure. For instance, we use a\ncombination of standard and customized software platforms to manage, record, and report all aspects of our operations and, in many instances, enable our\ncustomers to remotely access certain areas of our databases to monitor yields, inventory positions, work-in-progress status and vendor quality data. We are\nconstantly expanding and updating our information technology infrastructure in response to our changing needs. Any failure to manage, expand and update\nour information technology infrastructure or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure could harm our business.\nDespite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damage caused by computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized\naccess and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. To the extent that any\ndisruption, cyber-attack or other security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, our business\ncould be harmed. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in\nthe future.\nIntellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur services involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of intellectual property infringement claims\nfrom third parties and claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers.\nOur customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement arising out of our manufacturing processes.\nIf any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these claims have merit, we could be required to expend\nsignificant resources in defense of such claims. In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of time and money\nto develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable\nterms or at all, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAny failure to protect our customers’ intellectual property that we use in the products we manufacture for them could harm our customer\nrelationships and subject us to l"}

We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable\nterms or at all, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAny failure to protect our customers’ intellectual property that we use in the products we manufacture for them could harm our customer\nrelationships and subject us to liability.\nWe focus on manufacturing complex optical products for our customers. These products often contain our customers’ intellectual property, including\ntrade secrets and know-how. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our customers’ intellectual property. We may maintain separate and\nsecure areas for customer proprietary manufacturing processes and materials and dedicate floor space, equipment, engineers and supply chain management\nto protect our customers’ proprietary drawings, materials and products. The steps we take to protect our customers’ intellectual property may not\nadequately prevent its disclosure or misappropriation. If we fail to protect our customers’ intellectual property, our customer relationships could be harmed,\nand we may experience difficulty in establishing new customer relationships. In addition, our customers might pursue legal claims against us for any failure\nto protect their intellectual property, possibly resulting in harm to our reputation and our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTax, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to the risk of increased income taxes, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in Thailand, the PRC, the U.K., the U.S. and Israel. Our effective income tax rate, provision for income\ntaxes and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including the results of tax audits and examinations, income before taxes\nbeing lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in\nincome tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, failure to meet obligations with respect to tax exemptions, and changes in\ntax laws and regulations. From time to time, we engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.\nAs of March 28, 2025, our U.S. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for the tax years 2019 through 2022. The Company is currently\nunder examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023. In addition, tax returns that remain open to examination\nin Thailand, the PRC, the U.K. and Israel range from the tax years 2017 through 2023. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns\nand continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and tax liability.\nWe base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries\nin which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by tax authorities and to possible\nchanges in law, which may have retroactive effect. Fabrinet (the “Cayman Islands Parent”) is an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands.\nWe maintain manufacturing operations in Thailand, the PRC, the U.S. and Israel. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions\nmay require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to tax in the Cayman\nIslands on income or capital gains until March 6, 2039.\nPreferential tax treatment from the Thai government in the form of a corporate tax exemption on income generated from projects to manufacture\ncertain products at our Chonburi campus is available to us through June 2026. Similar preferential tax treatment was available to us through June 2020 with\nrespect to products manufactured at our Pinehurst campus. After June 2020, 50% of our income generated from products manufactured at our Pinehurst\ncampus will be exempted from tax through June 2025. Preferential tax treatment is available to us for products manufactured at our Chonburi campus\nBuilding 9, where income generated will be tax exempt through 2031, capped at our actual investment amount. Such preferential tax treatment is\ncontingent on various factors, including the export of our customers’ products out of Thailand and our agreement not to move our manufacturing facilities\nout of our current province in Thailand for at least 15 years from the date on which preferential tax treatment was granted. We will lose this favorable tax\ntreatment in Thailand unless we comply with these restrictions, and as a result we may delay or forego certain strategic business decisions due to these tax\nconsiderations.\nThere is also a risk that Thailand or another jurisdiction in which we operate may treat the Cayman Islands Parent as having a permanent\nestablishment in such jurisdiction and subjec"}

If we become subject to additional taxes in any jurisdiction or if any jurisdiction begins to\ntreat the Cayman Islands Parent as having a permanent establishment, such tax treatment could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nCertain of our subsidiaries provide products and services to, and may from time to time undertake certain significant transactions with, us and our\nother subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. For instance, we have intercompany agreements in place that provide for our California and Singapore\nsubsidiaries to provide administrative services for the Cayman Islands Parent, and the Cayman Islands Parent has entered into manufacturing agreements\nwith our Thai subsidiary. In general, related\n53\nTable of Contents\nparty transactions and, in particular, related party financing transactions, are subject to close review by tax authorities. Moreover, several jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate have tax laws with detailed transfer pricing rules that require all transactions with non-resident related parties to be priced using arm’s\nlength pricing principles and require the existence of contemporaneous documentation to support such pricing. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions could\nchallenge the validity of our related party transfer pricing policies. Such a challenge generally involves a complex area of taxation and a significant degree\nof judgment by management. If any tax authorities are successful in challenging our financing or transfer pricing policies, our income tax expense may be\nadversely affected and we could become subject to interest and penalty charges, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced that it has reached agreement among its member countries to\nimplement Pillar Two rules, a global minimum tax at 15% for certain multinational enterprises. The OECD has issued Pillar Two model rules and continues\nto release guidance on these rules. Many countries have enacted tax laws that will take effect in 2024 and 2025 to implement Pillar Two rules, while other\ncountries have announced plans to adopt these rules. We evaluated the applicable tax law changes resulting from Pillar Two implementation in the countries\nwhere we operate, and there was no material impact to our tax provision for the nine months ended March 28, 2025. As additional jurisdictions enact such\nlegislation in the future, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase. We will continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments\nrelated to global minimum tax matters to assess the impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will\nbe required to continue to devote substantial time to various compliance initiatives.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as other rules implemented by\nthe SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate\ngovernance practices. These and proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs. If\ncompliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns, it could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. While we were able to assert in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 28, 2024, we cannot predict the outcome of our\ntesting in future periods. If we are unable to assert in any future reporting periods that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our\nindependent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), we could lose investor\nconfidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on our share price.\nGiven the nature and complexity of our business and the fact that some members of our management team are located in Thailand while others are\nlocated in the U.S., control deficiencies may periodically occur.

While we have ongoing measures and procedures to prevent and remedy control\ndeficiencies, if they occur there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that we will be able to prevent material weaknesses or significant\ndeficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Moreover, if we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial\nreporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses in future periods, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline and we could be subject to\npotential delisting by the NYSE and review by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require us to expend additional financial\nand management resources. As a result, our shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the market\nprice of our ordinary shares.\nIf we are unable to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for the products we manufacture,\nour business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nAs a manufacturer of products for the optics industry, we are required to meet certain certification standards, including the following: ISO 9001 for\nManufacturing Quality Management Systems; ISO 14001 for Environmental Management Systems; TL 9000 for Telecommunications Industry Quality\nCertification; IATF 16949 for Automotive Industry Quality Certification; ISO 13485 for Medical Devices Industry Quality Certification; AS 9100 for\nAerospace Industry Quality Certification; NADCAP (National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program) for Quality Assurance\nthroughout the Aerospace and Defense Industries; ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems; ISO/IEC 17025 for Testing and\nCalibration Laboratories Certification; ISO 22301 for Business Continuity Management Systems; and ISO/IEC 27001 for Information Security\nManagement Systems. We also maintain compliance with various additional standards imposed by the FDA with respect to the manufacture of medical\ndevices.\n54\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, we are required to register with the FDA and other regulatory bodies and are subject to continual review and periodic inspection for\ncompliance with various regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. We hold the following additional certifications:\nANSI ESD S20.20 for facilities and manufacturing process control, in compliance with ESD standard; Transported Asset Protection Association (\"TAPA\")\nand Custom Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (\"C-TPAT\") for Logistic Security Management System; and CSR-DIW for Corporate Social\nResponsibility in Thailand. In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our precision optical, electro-\nmechanical and electronic manufacturing services and we must undergo periodic inspections by regulatory bodies to obtain and maintain these\ncertifications. If any regulatory inspection reveals that we are not in compliance with applicable standards, regulators may take action against us, including\nissuing a warning letter, imposing fines on us, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, or closing our manufacturing facilities.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it could harm our reputation as well as our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand operating results.\nThe sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental laws and regulations. In addition, rules\nadopted by the SEC implementing the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 impose diligence and disclosure\nrequirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in the products we\nmanufacture for our customers. Compliance with these rules has resulted in additional cost and expense, including for due diligence to determine and verify\nthe sources of any conflict minerals used in the products we manufacture, and may result in additional costs of remediation and other changes to processes\nor sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the\nproducts we manufacture, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals that can be used in the products we\nmanufacture for our customers.\nAlthough we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and these laws and regulations, we will need to\nensure that we and, in some cases, our suppliers comply with applicable laws and regulations.

If we fail to timely comply with such laws and regulations,\nour customers may cease doing business with us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In\naddition, if we were found to be in violation of these laws, we could be subject to governmental fines, liability to our customers and damage to our\nreputation, which would also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares\nOur share price may be volatile due to fluctuations in our operating results and other factors, including the activities and operating results of\nour customers or competitors, any of which could cause our share price to decline.\nOur revenues, expenses and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-\nyear due to the risk factors described in this section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to market and industry factors, the\nprice and trading volume of our ordinary shares may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors relating to us, our competitors, our customers\nand the markets we serve, many of which are beyond our control. Factors such as variations in our total revenues, earnings and cash flow, announcements\nof new investments or acquisitions, changes in our pricing practices or those of our competitors, commencement or outcome of litigation, sales of ordinary\nshares by us or our principal shareholders, fluctuations in market prices for our services and general market conditions could cause the market price of our\nordinary shares to change substantially. Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares\ntrade. Volatility and weakness in our share price could mean that investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices they paid and could\nalso impair our ability in the future to offer our ordinary shares or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and/or as consideration in the\nacquisition of other businesses.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices\nof equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or\ninternational currency fluctuations, may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in\nthe market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities\nlitigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our\nbusiness.\n55\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or if they publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, the market\nprice and trading volume of our ordinary shares could decline.\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our\nbusiness. If securities or industry analysts stop covering us, or if too few analysts cover us, the market price of our ordinary shares could be adversely\nimpacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our ordinary shares or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business,\nour market price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our\nordinary shares could decrease, which could cause the market price or trading volume of our ordinary shares to decline.\nWe may become a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences to U.S. investors.\nBased upon estimates of the value of our assets, which are based in part on the trading price of our ordinary shares, we do not expect to be a passive\nforeign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year 2024 or for the foreseeable future. However, despite our\nexpectations, we cannot guarantee that we will not become a PFIC for the taxable year 2024 or any future year because our PFIC status is determined at the\nend of each year and depends on the\ncomposition of our income and assets during such year.

If we become a PFIC, our U.S. investors will be subject to increased tax liabilities under U.S. tax\nlaws and regulations as well as burdensome reporting requirements.\nOur business and share price could be negatively affected as a result of activist shareholders.\nIf an activist investor takes an ownership position in our ordinary shares, responding to actions by such activist shareholder could be costly and time-\nconsuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future\ndirection as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of our board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction\nof our business or other instability, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more\ndifficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or do business with our competitors\ninstead of us because of any such issues, then our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, our share\nprice could experience periods of increased volatility as a result of shareholder activism.\nCertain provisions in our constitutional documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which could limit our shareholders'\nopportunity to sell shares at a premium.\nOur constitutional documents include provisions that could limit the ability of others to acquire control of us, modify our structure or cause us to\nengage in change-of-control transactions, including, among other things, provisions that:\n• establish a classified board of directors;\n• prohibit our shareholders from calling meetings or acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n• limit the ability of our shareholders to propose actions at duly convened meetings; and\n• authorize our board of directors, without action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares and additional ordinary shares.\nThese provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their ordinary shares at a premium over prevailing\nmarket prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to acquire control of us in a tender offer or similar transaction.\nOur shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (“MOA”), by the Companies Law (as\namended) of the Cayman Islands and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our\ndirectors under the laws of the Cayman Islands are not as clearly established under statutes or judicial precedent as in jurisdictions in the U.S. Therefore,\nour shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the U.S.,\ndue to the comparatively less developed nature of Cayman Islands law in this area.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThe Companies Law permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and between Cayman Islands companies and non-\nCayman Islands companies. Dissenting shareholders have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be\ndetermined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow the required procedures, subject to certain exceptions. Court approval is not required for a merger\nor consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures.\nIn addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is\napproved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must in addition\nrepresent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy\nat a meeting convened for that purpose.

This may make it more difficult for our shareholders to assess the value of any consideration they\nmay receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give them additional consideration if they believe the consideration offered is\ninsufficient.\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or\nto obtain copies of lists of shareholders. Our directors have discretion under our MOA to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our\ncorporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult\nfor our shareholders to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders\nin connection with a proxy contest.\nSubject to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors.\nCertain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable.\nThe Cayman Islands Parent is a Cayman Islands exempted company and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the U.S. Given our\ndomicile and the location of our assets, it may be difficult to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts based on the civil liability\nprovisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands, Thailand or the PRC would\nrecognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. or any state. In\nparticular, a judgment in a U.S. court would not be recognized and accepted by Thai courts without a re-trial or examination of the merits of the case. In\naddition, there is uncertainty as to whether such Cayman Islands, Thai or PRC courts would be competent to hear original actions brought in the Cayman\nIslands, Thailand or the PRC against us predicated upon the securities laws of the U.S. or any state.\nGeneral Risks\nEnergy price volatility may negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources in our manufacturing and transportation activities. Energy prices have\nbeen subject to increases and general volatility caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuation, production and transportation\ndisruption, world events and government regulations. While we are currently experiencing lower energy prices, a significant increase is possible, which\ncould increase our raw material and transportation costs. In addition, increased transportation costs of our suppliers and customers could be passed along to\nus.

Sharp is currently under -\ntaking major transformations for our future growth, and it is a great challenge for me to assume the \nheavy responsibility of President and CEO.   \nOpening Remarks\nI joined Sharp in 1980 and dedicated my whole career to the Company. My deep commitment to \nthe Company and strong desire to mold Sharp into a company admired worldwide are second to \nnone.\nI would like to begin by sharing three principles that I have learned from my mentors and have \ncome to deeply value and apply in my business management.     \nThe first is our Business Philosophy and Business Creed. Our Business Philosophy expresses \nthe ideal figure we should aim for, and our Business Creed explains the thoughts and beliefs we \nshould all hold to achieve this Philosophy. Only by cherishing these two elements can we embody \nthe true Sharp character that enables us to create unique values from a perspective different from \nthat of other companies.\nThe second is to make efforts every day and never give up. This expresses the spirit of founder \nHayakawa who overcame countless challenges. I encouraged myself with these words and over -\ncame many difficulties. Now is the time to embody this spirit. I intend to lead Sharp by example to \nface challenges with the spirit to never give up.\nThe last principle is our quality slogan: Quality First in Heart and Mind . We ran into a quality \nproblem during my time as a section manager that required painstaking efforts to regain trust.      \nThis experience reinforced my belief that prioritizing quality and earning customer trust is of ut-\nmost importance. To this day, I still hang a poster of this slogan in my office as a daily reminder.\nMy Mission\nOur current business environment is more challenging than anticipated. Although the brand business \nachieved steady profits amid such circumstances, performance in the Display Device business deterio-\nrated significantly. We recorded substantial losses in fiscal 2022 and 2023 and experienced a decline \nin our financial position as a result, falling short of stakeholders’ expectations for our company.\nSharp announced the Medium-Term Management Direction on May 14, 2024, focusing on re-\nforming the device business, establishing a new growth model, and reinforcing HQ functions.\nI will elaborate further on the specific details of this direction in the following section. I myself took \nresponsibility and played an active role in the formulation of this critical plan to revitalize Sharp.\nI recognize the path forward will not be an easy one, but as CEO, I am committed to executing \nthis Medium-Term Management Direction to meet the expectations of our stakeholders.\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n1\nMessage from the President\nCurrent Status and Issues\nSharp recorded operating losses for two consecutive terms due to the delay in corresponding to \nchanges in Display Device. The reason behind our stagnant growth is that we fell into the negative \ncycle, hindering our ability to enhance cash generation.\nWhile large-scale investment is required for the device business to remain competitive, we have \nnot been able to make sufficient investments for a long time. As a result, our competitiveness \ndeclined in the device business and hindered our ability to develop new categories, attract new cus-\ntomers, and explore other growth areas. The business became more susceptible to changes in sup-\nply, demand, prices, and other market conditions, making it difficult to generate stable profits.       \nMeanwhile, even though the brand business has been performing well, investments in the future \ngrowth has been restricted under these circumstances.\nSharp must break out of this cycle quickly and establish a sustainable profit structure to ensure \ncontinued growth.   \nPerformance trend Summary of the past two years\nStructural issues\n•  Despite tough business environment, the brand business has secured \na steady profit\n•  Progress has been made in each segment towards new business \ndevelopment\n• Operating loss in two consecutive terms\n• Mainly due to delay in corresponding to change in Display Device\n SDP continued to record losses after consolidation*\n Small- and medium-size LCD busin"}

SDP halted panel production in August 2024 due to major market changes and diffi-\nculties in implementing its revitalization plan.

In addition, the consumer spending has shifted from the nesting demand to travel and eating out, \nresulting in weak demand for consumer electronics and other products. The brand businesses, which import products manufactured at \noverseas factories, and sell them in Japan, were negatively affected by the weakening yen.\nConsolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 amounted to 2,321.9 billion yen, down 8.9% year on year. Sales in Smart Life & Energy, \nUniversal Network, Display Device, and Electronic Device decreased, despite an increase in Smart Office sales.\nOperating loss narrowed to 20.3 billion yen, compared to an operating loss of 25.7 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Smart Office \nand Universal Network reported a significant increase in profit. However, the operating loss in Display Device increased significantly due to \nan abrupt deterioration in demand for small- and medium-size displays, and besides, Smart Life & Energy and Electronic Device recorded a \ndecrease in profit. Ordinary loss was 7.0 billion yen, compared to an ordinary loss of 30.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Loss attribut-\nable to owners of the parent amounted to 149.9 billion yen, compared to a loss attributable to owners of the parent of 260.8 billion yen \nin the previous fiscal year. As non-operating income, we recorded foreign exchange gains of 13.3 billion yen and share of profit of entities \naccounted for using equity method of 8.3 billion yen. In addition, as extraordinary income, we recorded a gain on change in equity of 4.2 \nbillion yen and a gain on reversal of liabilities of 4.8 billion yen as a result of the decrease in the ownership interest in SDP Global (China) \nCo., Ltd., an equity-method affiliate of Sakai Display Products Corporation, while we recorded extraordinary losses including impairment \nlosses of 122.3 billion yen related to Display Device and business restructuring expenses of 11.7 billion yen.\nSharp decided there would be no dividend payment for fiscal 2023, as the Company posted a net loss for t"}

Our aim is to realize a sustainable global \nenvironment by setting long-term goals for 2050 in the areas of climate change, resource recy-\ncling, and safety and security.\nToward achieving the SHARP Eco Vision 2050, we have defined long term goals in the three following areas to generate clean energy in excess of energy consumed and minimize the environmental impact of corporate \nactivities on the global environment.\nThroughout our history, Sharp has endeavored to reduce the energy \nwe use as an organization, while making more energy-efficiency \nproducts to help reduce the amount of energy consumed in the \nhome and by society.\nAs our founder, Tokuji Hayakawa, said, “Everything we produce \nuses electricity. As we become a bigger company, we will be respon-\nsible for using more electricity, so I propose that we also begin \nmaking electricity.” Following this course, Sharp began development \nof solar cell, striving to popularize photovoltaic power generation for \nmore than 50 years.\nSharp factories use a variety of chemical \nsubstances in the product manufactur-\ning process. Our products also contain a \nvariety of chemical substances. Chemical \nsubstances include substances that \nhave a negative impact on the human \nbody, the environment, and ecosystems. \nAccordingly, these chemicals must be \nmanaged in a careful and detailed manner.\nSharp has created new products that offer \na variety of value to the world. At the same \ntime, we have used many of the world’s \nresources.\nSharp supports the global goal of achieving carbon neutrality, and we have set ourselves \nthe challenge of meeting the following two goals by 2050 in our own activities and \nthroughout the supply chain as a whole, so that we can achieve a decarbonized society. \nSharp follows current international standards, as well as our own \nstandards oriented toward the future, for the strict management \nof these relevant chemical substances. Under these standards, we \nare striving to eliminate any negative effects that chemicals may \nhave on human health, the global environment, or ecosystems.\nSharp intends to reach new levels of effective resource use, \nmaximizing value from minimal resources and constructing a \ncircular economy. We have defined two goals to achieve by the \nyear 2050 in efforts to create a recycling-oriented society.\n•  Conduct proper management of chemical substances \nto protect human health, the global environment, \nand ecosystems\n• Eliminate the use of new mined resources* in products\n•  Eliminate final disposal of waste products generated \nthrough our business activities\nAs a company that makes products that use electricity, we must take\nresponsibility for the environmental impact of this electricity usage.\nLong-Term Environmental Targets\nFurthermore, in order to realize our long-term environmental vision, we are formulating “me-\ndium-term environmental goals” that set specific initiatives and quantitative goals for each area. \nWith regard to climate change, a pressing issue worldwide, we accelerate our efforts to achieve \nnet-zero CO2 emissions arising from our own business activities by 2030.\nSharp is engaged in initiatives to solve social issues and sustainably raise corporate value. In \norder to accomplish the initiatives, we will work more closely with our stakeholders through corpo -\nrate and environmental conservation activities.\n*1 A state in which the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions minus the absorption volume is effectively zero. \n*2  An economic system in which discarded products and raw materials are considered as new resources and in which resources \nare circulated without generating waste products.\n• Achieve net zero CO 2 emissions due to our own business activities\n•  Generate clean energy in excess of the energy consumed throughout our \nsupply chain\nOur desire is to continue to offer a variety of value to our \nstakeholders amid the constraints of limited resources.\nSharp corporate activities must not do harm to human \nhealth, the global environment, or ecosystems.\nClimate \nChange\nResource \nRecycling\nGoals Goals Goals\nSee the following for more information on Sharp’s environmental activities.\nhttps://global.sharp/corporate/eco/environment/\nThe SHARP Eco Vision 2050, Our Long-Term Environmental Vision\nSafety and \nSecurity\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n15\nAddressing TCFD Recommendations\nThe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) formed by the Financial Stability \nBoard (international body that works toward financial systems stability) put forth recommendations \nthat companies disclose information on the risks and opportunities presented by climate change \nin 2017.

The Sustainability Committee consists \nof the committee chair, senior management, headquarters functional divisions, business units, and \nsubsidiaries. The Committee is responsible for the thorough implementation of policies and vision \non ESG, including those on climate change. They also deliberate and promote measures and share \nthe latest trends in social issues.\nThrough monitoring and review by management at committee meetings, Sharp continuously \nstrengthens climate change action to play a part in making society sustainable.\n2.Strategy\nSharp considers climate change as one of our medium- to long-term risks and opportunities. We \nexplore strategies and organizational resilience in light of related risks and opportunities. We con-\nducted a scenario analysis referring to climate change scenarios (1.5°C scenario\n*2\n and 4°C scenario\n*3\n) \nby the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to \nconsider long-term impacts up to the year 2050.\nSee the following website for more information on each risk and opportunity, as well as our meas-\nures taken.\nhttps://global.sharp/corporate/eco/environment/climate_change/\n3.Risk Management\nBased on the Business Risk Management Guidelines which defines the basic concept of business risk \nmanagement, Sharp manages and assesses risks, including climate-related risks, in an integrated manner. \nWe identify high-probability climate risks by analyzing projected future climate scenarios. We re-\nport the details of the analysis to senior management and the Internal Control Planning Division \n(secretariat of the Risk Management Office) as necessary. Measures for improvement are discussed \namong the related departments.\n4.Metrics and Target\nIn 2019, Sharp established the long-term environmental vision SHARP Eco Vision 2050 based on our \nprincipal environmental philosophy of “Creating an Environmentally Conscious Company with \nSincerity and Creativity”, which was established in 1992.

Based on this policy, we \nhave formulated and published the SHARP Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook in accord -\nance with the RBA Code of Conduct, and, in our basic agreements for ongoing transactions, have \nestablished mandatory compliance with Guidebook-based CSR initiatives for our suppliers.\nIn order to identify, assess, and appropriately address CSR risks such as forced labor in the supply \nchain, we conduct CSR/green procurement surveys for each of our suppliers’ plants on a regular basis \nin accordance with the RBA Self-Assessment \nQuestionnaire. We also provide feedback on as-\nsessment results and require suppliers with plants \nthat scored low in any area to submit improve -\nment plans. In this way, we work to enhance \nsustainable CSR initiatives. In fiscal 2023, we con-\nducted CSR/green procurement surveys at 393 \nbases of 99 companies that we procure from.\nWe will continue to strengthen our CSR ef-\nforts throughout the supply chain, aiming to \nbuild a globally responsible supply chain.\nIn recent years, in addition to legal frameworks such as the U.S.’s Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act and the EU’s Conflict Minerals Convention, the scope of responsible \nmineral procurement has been expanding in terms of minerals, regions, and risks. Society demands \nthat companies practice responsible mineral procurement from CSR perspectives against the back-\ndrop of child labor and environmental destruction at mineral mining sites. Sharp’s basic policy is \nto take appropriate measures to ensure that we are neither complicit in human rights abuses or \nenvironmental destruction nor interfering with sound and legitimate local business activities in our \nsupply chain for procuring minerals mined in conflict-affected and high-risk areas.\nUnder this basic policy, we established an investigation system at each of our major business units \nand manufacturing subsidiaries. Through our membership in industry associations such as the Respon-\nsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association \n(JEITA), we monitor the latest global trends and pursue relevant measures based on the OECD Due Dili-\ngence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.\nFurthermore, the Sustainability Committee*, chaired by the Representative President and CEO, \ndesignates responsible mineral procurement as a key theme for initiatives and monitors the progress \nof related measures.\n*Please refer to P .12.\nTo gain customer trust and improve sat-\nisfaction, Sharp responds to customer \nneeds and demands by offering products \nand services that are safe, high-quality, \nand reliable.\nQuality Assurance System\nSharp specifies the quality levels we \npromise to customers, thereby ensur -\ning all employees in every department \ninvolved in product planning, design, \nproduction, sales, and after-sales service \ncontinue to strive for improved quality.\nIn recent years, expectations and demands related to supply chain due diligence initiatives have \nbeen increasing in light of the emergence of human rights and environmental risks in the global \nsupply chain, as well as the strengthening of related laws, regulations, and import/export restric-\ntions in various countries.\nSharp joined the RBA officially in December 2021.

We strive to foster professional employ-\nees by providing employees opportunities to pursue independent learning whenever and wherever \nthey are. Our e-learning environment allows employees to easily learn anytime, anywhere using \ncomputers or smartphones at home, actively helping employees enhance their abilities through \nself-development.\nSharp’s approach to diversity is clearly stated in our Business Philosophy: “It is the intention of our \ncorporation to grow hand-in-hand with our employees, encouraging and aiding them to reach \ntheir full potential and improve their standard of living.” We aim to lead to new value propositions \nby innovating through the mutual respect of individual employee personalities, developing inno-\nvative technologies unique to the Company, and providing services. Diversity management is a \nhuman resources strategy for utilizing a diverse range of employees; it is also a business strategy.\nThe Sharp Code of Conduct states, “In any corporate activities, including employment practices such as \nhiring, compensation, promotion, opportunities for training and the like, we do not take any action that \nconstitutes discrimination based on nationality, race, ethnic group, color, sex, physical health, pregnancy, \nsexual orientation, age, marital status, religion, creed, social status, birth, property, bodily feature, phys-\nical or mental disability, political opinion, and the like,” and that, “We will actively take part in efforts to \nenhance the work environment where employees with diverse characteristics can fully demonstrate their \nabilities.” This is what Sharp is actively working towards, giving individual consideration based on need.\nSharp implements No Overtime Days and encourages all employees to plan for and use annual paid \nleave to establish an efficient and balanced work style. In 2023, we eliminated the requirement for \nemployees to justify their use of the telecommuting system, assuming employees in question is capa-\nble of maintaining or enhancing their productivity. We also increased the number of days per week \nthat the system can be used. At the same time, we expanded flexible hours under the flextime sys-\ntem, establishing a more adaptable work environment regarding location and time.\nFurthermore, we strive to improve work-life balance by expanding and encouraging the use of \nsystems that help employees balance work with childcare, nursing care, and medical treatment. \nFor childcare support, we distribute guidebooks and inform employees about our individual sys-\ntems, resulting in numerous employees utilizing leave for childcare.\nSocial Initiatives\nTalent Management (HITO-oriented Management) \nHuman Resource Development\nDiversity Management\nWork-Life Balance Initiatives\nSee the following for more information on human resources.\nhttps://global.sharp/corporate/eco/social/\nEvolve performance-based \nreward system to support \nyoung generation\n(1) Realize speedy promotion\n based on job responsibility\n(2) Annual salary increase\n  with variation considering\n reward standards\n(3) Bonus system realizing\n higher standards based\n on business performance\nEstablish work treatment \nsystem effective on \ncollecting personnel\n(1) Raise reward level of\n excellent young talent\n observing market standards\n(2) Realize flexible work styles\n and work spots\n(3) Enrich welfare such as \n dorm, canteen, healthcare\n measures etc.\nFulfill methods to support \ndevelopment of personnel\n(1) Enrich education program for\n  next-generation management \n executives / startup training\n(2) Aggressively provide\n opportunities to work\n overseas\n(3) Promote job mobility\n within business groups\nImprove organization \nrejuvenation / decision-\nmaking speed\n(1) Further strengthen \n recruitment\n(2) Aggressively assign young\n employees to key posts\n(3) Promote flattening of \n organizations\nybridH nnovationI alentT pportunityO\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n19\nMessages from Outside Directors\nI worked at a business firm until March 2024, handling a wide range of responsibilities.

I aim to contribute to Sharp as an outside director by leveraging my knowledge \nand experience in business transformation, digital transformation, and sustainability transforma-\ntion during a time of VUCA*.\nSharp is executing significant structural reforms, carrying out Asset Light Initiatives to achieve its \nnew growth strategy. This is a pivotal year as the Company stands at the starting line to remain a \ncompany recognized and valued by society for years to come. The Board of Directors engages in \ntransparent and frank discussions, fully aware of the challenging environment and other issues. \nIt goes without saying that I will monitor and advise the progress of these structural reforms. An-\nother area I want to focus on is human resources strategy, which is the driving force of ongoing \ncorporate value enhancement and must be aligned with business strategy.\nSharp’s business philosophy reads, “It is the intention of our corporation to grow hand-in-hand \nwith our employees, encouraging and aiding them to reach their full potential and improve their \nstandard of living.” I aim to contribute as an outside director to support the Company in continu-\ning to practice this philosophy in the context of today’s social environment. For instance, the num-\nber of female employees and the ratio of women in managerial positions remain low. I want the \nexecutive team to raise the quality of management by responding to a society with diverse values, \nenhancing workforce diversity, and listening to diverse voices. I also hope to play an advisory role \nby taking the opportunity to listen to those on the front lines.\nI expect Sharp to swiftly advance efforts to enhance physical, organizational, and institutional \nenvironments, empowering women and other diverse, motivated employees to unlock their poten-\ntial and thrive.\n*VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity\nPursuing Diversity and\nCorporate Value Enhancement\nYumiko Kajiwara\nOutside Director\nCorporate Governance Awareness: \nAn Essential Factor in Managing Listed Companies \nAkira Kiyota\nOutside Director\nAwareness of the importance of corporate governance began to grow in Japan around 2000. \nUnder the second Abe administration beginning late 2012, the “Abenomics” growth strategy \nintroduced initiatives to boost the profitability of Japanese companies and enhance shareholder \nvalue. In response, the Financial Services Agency and Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) formulated \nthe Corporate Governance Code  in March 2015, which went into effect for all listed companies in \nJune 2015. Corporate governance refers to the framework that ensures companies make transpar -\nent, fair, timely, and decisive decisions, taking into account the positions of shareholders, custom-\ners, employees, local communities, and others.\nTransparent and clear management from a shareholder’s perspective backed by compelling man-\nagement visions and strategies is essential for listed companies. Such factors allow listed companies \nto be well-regarded in capital markets and achieve sustainable growth. The Corporate Governance \nCode responds to this need, aiming to improve shareholder returns by supporting management \ncommitted to improving corporate value over the medium- to long-term through constructive \nshareholder dialogue. The Corporate Governance Code adopts a comply or explain  framework to \nencourage companies to either adopt its standards or explain reasons for non-compliance, thereby \npromoting proactive governance. As listed companies face significant shifts in their business envi-\nronments, management must consider ways to achieve sustainable growth and create long-term \ncorporate value, while exploring effective frameworks to achieve these goals. \nThe TSE revised its market segments for the first time since the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the \nOsaka Securities Exchange merged, reclassifying the previous four segments—TSE 1st Section, TSE \n2nd Section, JASDAQ, and Mothers—to clarify segment concepts. The new structure introduces \nthe Prime Market segment, where companies are expected to maintain a higher standard of cor -\nporate governance.\nThe Corporate Governance Code has undergone multiple revisions since its introduction, urging \nmanagement to enhance effectiveness through measures including improving board functionality \nand fostering diversity among core members. The Corporate Governance Code also calls for pro-\nactive efforts to enhance sustainability.\nToday, nearly all executives of companies listed on the Prime Market actively engage in corporate \ngovernance. I am committed to supporting Sharp in their efforts to strengthen corporate governance \nand enhance corporate value.\nBasic Concepts\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n20\nSharp’s business philosophy contains this statement: “Our future prosperity is directly linked to the \nprosperity of our customers, dealers and shareholders... indeed, the entire Sharp family.” Under this \nphilosophy, Sharp’s basic concept concerning corporate governance is to maximize corporate value \nthr"}

I am committed to supporting Sharp in their efforts to strengthen corporate governance \nand enhance corporate value.\nBasic Concepts\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n20\nSharp’s business philosophy contains this statement: “Our future prosperity is directly linked to the \nprosperity of our customers, dealers and shareholders... indeed, the entire Sharp family.” Under this \nphilosophy, Sharp’s basic concept concerning corporate governance is to maximize corporate value \nthrough swift and accurate management that preserves transparency, objectivity and soundness.\nBased on this stance, Sharp appoints outside directors who have deep insight and a wealth of ex-\nperience in the fields of social and economic trends, management, and so forth. In the institutional \ndesign of the company, we have chosen to become a company with an audit & supervisory commit-\ntee. This format increases the agility of our decision-making, while strengthening oversight of the \nexecution of duties.\nWith regard to the execution of business, Sharp separates the supervisory and decision-making \nfunctions from the business execution functions through the introduction of the Executive Officers \nSystem. This system enables the prompt, efficient, and consistent conduct of business. Sharp has also \norganized its business structure by decentralizing management to clarify the profit responsibilities of \neach business unit. In this way we have been strengthening our individual businesses and operations, \nexercising control through the Chairperson’s Office, President’s Office, and the Business Strategy \nPlanning Office, organizations within our headquarters.\nSharp’s corporate governance system comprises the Board of Directors, which supervises directors’ \nexecution of duties, and the Audit & Supervisory Committee, which audits the directors’ execution of \nduties, together with Executive Officers System which separates the supervisory and decision-making \nfunctions from the business execution functions.\nMeetings of the Board of Directors of Sharp Corporation make decisions on matters stipulated by \nlaw and management-related matters of importance, and supervise the state of business execution. \nThe Company also has an Internal Control Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nom-\ninating Committee. These committees serve as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors. In addition, \nimportant transactions between the parent company group and Sharp Group which need to be \nsubmitted for discussion at the Executive Management Meeting are reviewed and approved by the \nBoard of Directors, the majority of whom are independent outside directors, to determine the neces-\nsity, rationality, and appropriateness of the transaction in question.\nIn addition to the Board of Directors, the Company has set up an Executive Management Committee \nwhose members are executive officers. The Executive Management Meeting deliberates in an appropriate \nand timely manner on matters of importance related to corporate management and business operations. \nThis committee facilitates prompt executive decision-making.\nThe Audit & Supervisory Committee is comprised of three directors, all of whom are outside di-\nrectors having high levels of professional knowledge. Two of the Audit & Supervisory Committee \nmembers are independent directors and one member is a full-time Audit & Supervisory Committee \nmember. The Audit & Supervisory Committee members hold regular meetings with executive direc-\ntors, accounting auditors, the head of the Internal Audit Division and others to exchange opinions \nand endeavor to ensure that business is conducted legally, appropriately, and efficiently.\nStatus of Corporate Governance System  (As of June 28, 2024)\nSupervisory/decision-making\nfunctions\nAudit\nfunctions\nOrdinary General Meeting of Shareholders\nSupplement\nReport\nReport\nReport\nMonitoring\nCoordination\nAudit/\nsupervision\nElection/dismissal Election/dismissal\nSupervision/decision-making Audit\nCompensation\nCommittee\nInternal Control\nCommittee\nInternal Audit\nDivision\nAudit & Supervisory\nCommittee Ofﬁce\nBoard of Directors\nDirectors\nAudit & Supervisory\nCommittee\nAudit & Supervisory\nCommittee Members\n(Directors)\nNominating\nCommittee\nElection/dismissal\nSupplement\nAssist\nCoordination\nAccounting\nauditors\nCoordination\nBusiness\nexecution\nfunctions\nBusiness Execution Unit\nOperational\naudit\nElection/dismissal\nAppointment/removal/\nsupervisionRaise discussed\nmatters/report\nDeliberation on key policies\nExecutive\nManagement Meeting\nExecutives\nExecutive Directors\nAudit Accounting\naudit\nRaise discussed matters\nOrganization Membership (  : Committee chair) (As of June 28, 2024)\nTitle Name Bord of \nDirectors\nAudit & \nSupervisory \nCommittee\nExecutive \nManagement \nMeeting\nNominating \nCommittee\nCompensation \nCommittee\nInternal \nControl \nCommittee\nDeputy Chairman, Member of the Board Po-Hsuan Wu ◎ ○ ○ ○ ○\nPresident & CEO, Member of the Board Masahiro Okitsu ○ ◎ ○ ○ ◎\nMember of the Board(Outside Director) Akira Kiyota ○ ○ ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director) Ching-Ray Chang ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director) Seiichi Nagatsuka ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director) Yumiko Kajiwara ○ ○ ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director)* Hsu-Tung Lu ○ ◎ ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director)* Yasu"}

Sharp is currently engaged in the development and operation \nof internal control systems in accordance with this Basic Policy. The Internal Control Committee, \nwhich serves as an advisory body to the Board of Directors, deliberates on basic policies regarding \ninternal controls, internal audits, and the status of internal controls-related policies and operations. \nThe committee reports on or refers matters to the Board of Directors as necessary. Sharp has estab-\nlished departments to supervise and implement measures and initiatives related to internal controls \non a company-wide basis. Sharp has also established an independent internal audit division to evalu-\nate the effectiveness of internal control and provide feedback on a continuing basis.\nTo enhance compliance throughout the Group, Sharp introduced the Sharp Group Charter of \nCorporate Behavior, a set of principles to guide corporate behavior, and the Sharp Code of Con-\nduct, which clarifies the conduct expected of all directors, executives, and employees of Sharp. \nDisseminating these throughout the Company and conducting annual trainings fosters a mindset \nof preventing problems before they occur. In accordance with the basic rules of compliance, Sharp \nis also developing a company-wide compliance promotion system. Sharp is also formulating the \nSharp Group Compliance Guidebook which points out specific standards for items to be observed, \nprohibited items, and actions to be taken by all directors, executives, and employees. This is being \nprovided to the whole company in order to ensure thorough compliance.\nOn the subject of compliance-related whistleblowing systems, we have established the Crystal \nHotline to handle various issues regarding compliance, including organizational or individual viola-\ntions of the law or ethics at Sharp or domestic subsidiaries as well as the Competition Law Hotline \nto handle issues regarding competition laws. These hotlines have been established both internally \nand externally (making use of advisory law firm services) in keeping with the Whistleblower Protec-\ntion Act and may be used by any employees or temporary employees of the Sharp Group in Japan, \nor employees of its business partners, etc*. In addition, our major overseas bases have also estab-\nlished similar whistleblowing and consultation facilities.\nTo deal comprehensively and systematically with a wide range of business risks, Sharp formulat-\ned its Business Risk Management Guidelines for the prevention of risk and for the swift response \nto any emerging risks.\n*Business partners may only use the Crystal Hotline.\nRegarding remuneration for directors (excluding directors on the Audit & Supervisory Committee), the \nOrdinary General Meeting of Shareholders, held June 27, 2024, resolved to cap cash remuneration at \n¥500 million per fiscal year (of which a maximum of ¥100 million may be paid to outside directors).\nThe Company grants restricted stock as nonmonetary remuneration or stock acquisition rights as \nstock options to directors, up to a limit of ¥300 million (150,000 shares or 1,500 units) per fiscal \nyear, of which a maximum of ¥30 million (15,000 shares or 150 units) may be granted to outside di-\nrectors. This allows us to better align values between Sharp directors and shareholders, as well as to \nstrengthen the sense of responsibility and increase motivation related to corporate performance.\nThe Compensation Committee, delegated authority by the Board of Directors, determines mone-\ntary remuneration for individual directors (excluding members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee) \nwithin the scope approved by the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.

This remuneration \nis designed to improve a greater awareness of the need for complete and comprehensive audits, to \nprevent loss of corporate value, and to maintain trust in the Company.\nThe Ordinary Meeting of General Shareholders approves the scope of monetary and nonmonetary \nremuneration for individual directors who are members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, the \namounts of which are then determined according to discussions among directors who are members \nof the Audit & Supervisory Committee.\nRemuneration, etc. for Sharp directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit & Su-\npervisory Committee) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 was ¥218 million (five directors, in -\ncluding one director who retired during the term). Remuneration, etc. for directors who are mem-\nbers of the Audit & Supervisory Committee was ¥73 million (three outside directors).\nThe Company does not disclose remuneration for individual directors.\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n22\nListed below are the principal business risks \nof Sharp that may have a significant influence \non investors’ decisions and countermeasures.\nNote that in addition to these, there exist \ncertain other risks that are difficult to foresee.\nEach of these risks has the potential to \nimpact the operations, business results, and \nfinancial position of Sharp.\nAll references to possible future develop-\nments in the following text were made by \nSharp as of March 31, 2024 (or June 28, 2024 \nas appropriate).\n(1) Global market trends and overseas businesses\n(Risk)\nSharp conducts our business not only in Japan but \nalso in different regions around the world. Business \nresults and financial position are thus subject to eco-\nnomic trends (especially private consumption and \ncorporate capital investment trends), competition \nwith other companies, product demand, raw mate-\nrial supply, and price fluctuations in each region \naround the world, including Japan.\nIn addition, various factors may have negative \nimpacts on Sharp performance and financial position. \nSuch factors include persistent global inflation, pro-\nlonged monetary tightening in Europe and the U.S. \nputting potential downward pressure on demand \nfor durable consumer goods, and sluggish con-\nsumer spending in China due to the stagnant real \nestate market.\n(Countermeasure)\nBusiness units that control Sharp’s overseas \nsubsidiaries collect risk and other information that \nmay impact Sharp’s operations, including global \nmarket trends, in cooperation with their local offices \nand make necessary operational decisions. Business \nresults of the overseas subsidiaries and business units \nare reported to management regularly, determin-\ning the necessary risk responses on a case-by-case \nbasis by analyzing the latest circumstances.\n(2) Exchange rate fluctuations\n(Risk)\nThe proportion of consolidated net sales accounted \nfor by overseas sales was 68.6% in fiscal 2022 and \n66.7% in fiscal 2023. Sharp sells products made \noverseas in the Japanese market, and also sells prod-\nucts in countries where it does not manufacture the \nproducts. Therefore, Sharp’s business results may \nbe impacted by exchange rate fluctuations.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp hedges the risk of exchange rate fluctuations \nby employing forward exchange contracts and \nexpanding and strengthening optimally located \nproduction.\n(3)  Dependence on certain businesses,  \nproducts, and clients\n(Risk)\nSharp’s device businesses account for nearly half \nof Sharp’s sales. Accordingly, Sharp’s earnings may \nbe impacted negatively by factors including slow-\ning customer demand for related products, falling \nproduct prices, or increasing competition due to \nthe emergence of substitute or competitive prod-\nucts, or the emergence of new competitors.\nSharp’s device businesses have high dependence \non a small number of specific clients for the sales \nof some of their products. Sharp’s business results \nand financial position could be affected if sales to \nsuch important clients languish due to not only  \nfactors related to Sharp’s products but reasons \noutside of Sharp’s control.

These include declin-\ning demand for the clients’ products, changes in \nproduct specifications, and changes in the clients’ \nsales strategies.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp aims to gain superior competitive advan-\ntages by accelerating a business model shift \nachieved by launching new high value-added ser -\nvice solutions; accelerating the global business \nexpansion and developing the business to the \nB2C and B2B markets, in addition to maintaining \nand expanding the existing business segments by \nexpanding the traditional hardware business.\n(4) Strategic alliances and collaborations\n(Risk)\nSharp has forged strategic alliances and collabora-\ntions with other companies in order to enhance \ncorporate competitiveness, improve profitability, \nand bolster the development of new technolo-\ngies and products in various business fields. If, \nhowever, any strategic issues with such strategic \npartners or other business issues arise, or goals \nchange, it may become difficult to maintain \nsuch alliances and collaborative ties with these \ncompanies, or to generate adequate results. In \nsuch cases, Sharp’s business results and financial \nposition may be impacted.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp believes that importance of strategic alli-\nances and collaborations will grow in the future. \nTo lead them to success, Sharp thoroughly verifies \nthe strategic necessity of the business, profitabil-\nity, and financial appropriateness at the stage of \nfeasibility study of strategic alliances and collabo -\nrations, and makes decisions after deliberation at \nthe Executive Management Meeting and the Board \nof Directors.\nAfter executing them, Sharp monitors the prog-\nress of the alliances and collaborations under close \ncooperation with the relevant business units, and \nreports to management early if it is determined \nthat the expected results cannot be achieved, to \nensure that measures can be taken to minimize \nthe impact they may have on Sharp’s business \nresults and financial position.\n(5) Relations with parent company group\n(Risk)\nThe equity investments from our parent company \ngroup (including Hon Hai Precision Industry, sub-\nsidiaries, and affiliates) allowed Sharp to invest in \ngrowth, and to pursue operational synergies using \nthe technological, productivity, and cost capa-\nbilities of our parent company group. However, \nwe cannot guarantee that operational synergies \nbetween Sharp and the parent company group \nwill occur as envisioned.\nRisk Factors\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n23\nA change in the parent company group’s busi-\nness strategies or competitive relationship with \nthe parent company group arising in the future \nmay adversely affect Sharp’s operations, business \nresults, and financial position.\nDecision making of important matters, such as \nmanagement policy and business development \nmay be biased by the parent company group and \nmaintaining our independence and autonomy \nmay not be possible.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp conducts business operations by maximiz-\ning operational synergies with the parent company \ngroup while fully respecting independence and \nautonomy between both entities and in close coop-\neration with the parent company group. Sharp \nidentifies areas where Sharp can create synergy \neffects with the parent company group, such as its \noperational efficiency improvement and expansion \nof its sales and profits, and Sharp appropriately \nverifies the expected synergies in those areas in \ncooperation with the parent company group in an \neffort to implement them.\nThe parent company group engages mainly in \noutsourced production of electronic equipment. \nThe Sharp Group handles the manufacturing and \nsales of telecommunications equipment, electri-\ncal appliances, and general electronics application \nequipment and components under the Sharp and \nother brands. Therefore, Sharp believes that there \nis no competition in the parent company group \nthat may impact Sharp’s operations.\nSharp strives to grow, develop, and improve its \nperformance in close cooperation with the parent \ncompany group, while fully respecting indepen-\ndence and autonomy between both entities. Sharp \nrecognizes that working together with the parent \ncompany group to increase Sharp’s operational \nefficiency and expand its sales and profits will ben-\nefit the interests of non-controlling shareholders.\n(6) Dealings with suppliers\n(Risk)\nSharp procures materials and receives services from \na large number of business partners. However, there \nis a risk that business partners may suffer deteriora-\ntion in performance due to slumping demand or \nsevere price erosion, unexpected M&A, or natural \ndisasters or accidents. They may also be affected \nby the U.S.-China trade friction, the situation in \nUkraine, labor costs, rising raw materials prices and \nenergy costs, legal regulations concerning human \nrights, environmental issues such as the problem \nof conflict minerals in the supply chain, or limited \nsuppliers with the capability of providing certain \nmaterial provisions.

Due to these and other factors, \nSharp may be unable to access sufficient supplies of \nmaterials/parts from procurement sources.\nIn such an event, Sharp may be forced to do \nbusiness with alternative suppliers subject to condi-\ntions less favorable than with its current suppliers, \nor Sharp may be unable to find an alternative sup-\nplier in a timely manner. Any of these factors could \nlead to increases in costs and/or delays in deliveries \nto customers, which may adversely affect Sharp’s \nbusiness results and financial position.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp conducts business with suppliers after car -\nrying out thorough credit checks. Additionally, \nSharp has introduced a supply chain CSR manage-\nment system to address risks in the supply chain, \nand regularly evaluates suppliers at domestic and \noverseas production sites, providing thorough \neducation and guidance. Furthermore, in order \nto ensure a stable supply of parts and materials \nand to optimize costs of procurement, Sharp is \nstrengthening partnerships with suppliers such as \nfor long-term quotas, and is also promoting pur -\nchasing from multiple companies.\n(7) Other factors affecting financial position\n(Risk)\nSharp raises funds through borrowings from finan-\ncial institutions such as banks. The debt to total \nassets ratio is 36.1% as of fiscal year ending March \n31, 2024. Sharp might become subject to restric-\ntions on how it uses its cash flows in order to repay \ndebt, and also face the possibility of an increase in \nexpenses due to rising interest rates. Sharp has the \npossibility of increases in fund raising costs as well \nas limitations on fund raising. This may be because \nnecessary funds cannot be raised at the required \ntime with adequate conditions, including for the \nrefinancing of existing debt. These factors may \naffect Sharp’s business results and financial position.\nSharp has borrowing agreements with multiple \nfinancial institutions, and some of the agreements \nentail financial covenants.

This situation violated \nthe financial covenants outlined in the loan agree-\nment. However, the lending institutions have \nagreed not to make this claim for forfeiture, and \nwe expect to continue our good business relation-\nship with the lender as in the past. \nSharp has implemented structural reforms, \nincluding production halt at Sakai Display Products \nCorporation, in the large-size display business and \nproduction capacity reduction and personnel opti-\nmization, in the small- and medium-size display \nbusiness, both of which contributed to the losses.\nAt the same time, we will continue our efforts to \nenhance profitability by creating distinctive prod-\nucts and new product categories and strengthening \noverseas businesses in the brand businesses.\nWe determined that there are no significant \nconcerns about cash flow in working capital and \ninvestment funds for the time being, as the impair-\nment loss is not one that involves an outflow of \nfunds and we achieved a total of 135,371 million \nyen in free cash flow, the sum of cash flows from \noperating and investing activities. Although events \nand circumstances exist that may raise significant \ndoubts about our premise of a going concern, \nno significant uncertainties have been identified. \nAs such, Notes Related to the Going Concern \nAssumption is not applicable.\n(8) Technological innovation\n(Risk)\nRapid technological advancement and proper \nresponse to changes in the business areas where \nSharp operates improves the competitiveness of \nSharp’s products and services, whereas insufficient \nresponse to the following items may adversely \naffect the growth and business results.\n•  Prediction and response to the technological \nadvancement and rise and fall, and their social \nsignificance\n•  Selection and concentration in R&D, and proper \nresource allocation\n•  Technological enhancement for new areas\n•  Acceleration of R&D in collaboration with exter-\nnal partners\nIn addition, there are moves to strengthen export \ncontrol of advanced technologies from the perspec-\ntive of international security. Export restrictions on \nproducts containing more than a certain amount of \nadded value from the targeted technologies could \nhave an indirect impact on our business.\n(Countermeasure)\nGroup research and development is not limited to \nmere improvement of technological standards, but \nalso focuses on creating technologies that solve \nissues arising with rapid changes in society. We \nfocus particularly on the application and devel-\nopment of Edge AI technology in growth areas \nsuch as carbon neutrality, industry digital trans-\nformation, and digital healthcare. We advance the \ncreation of new services and solutions by effec-\ntively utilizing our business foundation built to \ndate to promptly implement necessary technolo-\ngies in society. We also work to strengthen our \ntechnological capabilities and accelerate devel-\nopment through active collaboration outside the \nCompany. Through these initiatives, Sharp reduces \nrisks associated with social changes and techno-\nlogical innovations, and aims to become a brand \ncompany that continues to grow sustainably \nthrough technological advancement.\nIn addition to complying with export and import \ncontrol laws and regulations in the operational \nactivities, Sharp executes control for export and \nimport in conformance with laws and regulations \nas well as regulatory situation in each country \nand region in R&D to deal with the tightening of \ncontrol of emerging technologies involving social \nplatforms for global infrastructure, defense, secu-\nrity, and so on.\n(9) Intellectual property rights\n(Risk)\nSharp strives to protect its unique technologies by \nacquiring intellectual property rights in Japan and \nin other countries, and by concluding contracts \nwith other companies. There may also be instances \nin which no rights are granted to the group’s pat-\nent applications, or where a third party launches \nlitigation against Sharp, claiming infringement of \nintellectual property rights. \nResolution of cases may place a significant finan-\ncial burden on Sharp.

If defects \narise in any of these products, Sharp may incur \nresponsibility as a manufacturer and other obligations.\nThere is a risk of a large-scale product recall or \nlitigation caused by unforeseen events, which may \nadversely affect Sharp’s brand image or influence \nits business results and financial position.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp not only complies with public safety stan-\ndards in each country to ensure the safety of its \nproducts but also improves safety by combining the \nrisk assessment policy with its unique safety criteria. \nTo ensure safety even if an unexpected problem \narises, in particular criteria for inflammable struc-\nture, malfunction test, etc. were established, \nand they are revised when necessary to pursue a \nhigher level of safety, and training is performed \nfor internal stakeholders to ensure that the safety \ncriteria are understood and shared by the design \nand quality departments. Sharp has established \na system to ensure safety to make sure that an \nemergency action can be taken quickly and appro-\npriately when a problem arises. In order to fulfill \nits responsibility as a manufacturer in case product \ndefects do arise, Sharp has taken out insurance \nto cover compensations based on product liability.\n(11) Competition to secure skilled personnel\n(Risk)\nFailure to secure skilled personnel in the technol-\nogy and management fields could affect Sharp’s \nbusiness results and financial position.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp implements the following measures to \nsecure skilled personnel in the technology and \nmanagement fields.\nSharp actively hires new graduates in order to \nacquire new talents according to its business policies. \nSharp also actively hires experienced personnel in \norder to secure core personnel responsible for new \nbusinesses.\nSharp created education and training programs \nthat allow all employees to acquire basic and \nprofessional knowledge by self-driven learning \nto develop professional personnel who can fulfill \ntheir professional duties.\nAs a platform where diverse human resources \ncan work with peace of mind, Sharp actively imple-\nments initiatives in consideration of the work-life \nbalance of employees, such as creating various \nprograms to strike a balance between work and \nchild upbringing/care/treatment.\n(12) The impact of climate change\n(Risk)\nGroup business results and financial position could \nbe affected by stricter regulations on greenhouse \ngas emissions, increased energy costs associated \nwith the introduction of a carbon tax, and tighter \nmeasures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In \naddition, disasters caused by increasingly larger \ntyphoons and greater precipitation due to climate \nchange may cause production sites to suspend \noperations or interrupt parts supply.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp ensures compliance with existing regula-\ntions and standards. In addition, we strive to remain \nabreast of legal and regulatory trends and par -\nticipate in policy-making opportunities.

The functional department \nthat manages company-wide risks works together \nwith business units in charge of managing their \nbusiness segments to minimize and mitigate \nrisks and take the necessary measures to prevent \nthem. In addition, in case a specific risk arises, the \ndepartment where the incident arises reports it to \nthe internal control department that serves as risk \nmanagement secretariat as well as management, \nworks together with the relevant departments \nto respond to the relevant incident, and, when \nnecessary, considers company-wide improvement \nmeasures to prevent recurrence.\nRisk Factors\nMembers of the \nBoard\nAttendance at Board/ \nAudit and Supervisory Committee \nin FY2023\n(Meetings attended/ \nNo. of meetings held)(%)\nSkills Matrix\nCorporate \nManagement \nand Business \nStrategy\nInternational \nBusiness and \nOverseas \nExpertise\nEngineering \nand \nTechnology\nFinance and \nAccounting\nRisk\nManagement\nand Compliance\nPo-Hsuan Wu Board of Directors (12/12)(100%) ○ ○ ○ ○\nMasahiro \nOkitsu Board of Directors (12/12)(100%) ○ ○ ○ ○\nAkira Kiyota － ○ ○ ○ ○\nChing-Ray \nChang － ○ ○ ○ ○\nSeiichi \nNagatsuka － ○ ○ ○\nYumiko \nKajiwara － ○ ○ ○ ○\nHsu-Tung Lu \nBoard of Directors (12/12)(100%)\nAudit & Supervisory Committee \n(16/16)(100%)\n○ ○ ○\nYasuo \nHimeiwa\nBoard of Directors (12/12)(100%)\nAudit & Supervisory Committee \n(16/16)(100%)\n○ ○ ○\nYutaka \nNakagawa\nBoard of Directors (12/12)(100%)\nAudit & Supervisory Committee \n(16/16)(100%)\n○ ○ ○ ○\nMembers of the Board, Executives and Chairman\n(As of June 27, 2024)\nDeputy Chairman Po-Hsuan Wu Executive Managing Officer Yasufumi Sugahara\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer Masahiro Okitsu Executive Managing Officer Tetsuji Kawamura\nSenior Executive Managing Officer\nChief Financial Officer Yoshio Kosaka Executive Officer Yoshiro Nakano\nSenior Executive Managing Officer\nChief Technical Officer Mototaka Taneya Executive Officer Katsuhiro Kawai\nChairman Young-Way Liu\nMember of the Board \n(Representative)\nPo-Hsuan Wu\nMember of the Board \nAkira Kiyota\n○■\nMember of the Board\n(Member of Audit\n& Supervisory Committee)\nHsu-Tung Lu ○\nMember of the Board \n(Representative)\nMasahiro Okitsu\nMember of the Board \nChing-Ray Chang \n○■\nMember of the Board\n(Member of Audit\n& Supervisory Committee)\nYasuo Himeiwa ○■\nMember of the Board \nSeiichi Nagatsuka \n○■\nMember of the Board\n(Member of Audit\n& Supervisory Committee)\nYutaka Nakagawa ○■\nMember of the Board \nYumiko Kajiwara \n○■\n○ Outside Directors\n■ Independent Directors\nExecutives \nChairman\nMembers of the Board\nBoard of Directors Chairperson\nAudit & Supervisory Committee \nCommittee Chair\nNominating Committee and Compensation Committee Members (◎ indicates chairperson)\n・ Nominating Committee: Yutaka Nakagawa◎, Akira Kiyota, Yumiko Kajiwara, Po-Hsuan Wu, Masahiro Okitsu\n・ Compensation Committee: Yutaka Nakagawa◎, Akira Kiyota, Yumiko Kajiwara, Po-Hsuan Wu, Masahiro Okitsu\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n26\nFinancial Section\n28 Financial Review\n31 Consolidated Balance Sheets\n32 Consolidated Statements of Operations\n32 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n33 Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\n34 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n35 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n76 Consolidated Subsidiaries\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n27\nFinancial Review\nSharp Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries\nNet Sales\nConsolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended \nMarch 31, 2024 amounted to ¥2,321,921 mil-\nlion, down ¥226,196 million (8.9%) year on year.\nFinancial Results\nCost of sales decreased ¥243,253 million to \n¥1,974,032 million, while our cost of sales ratio \ndecreased from 87.0% to 85.0% year on year.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) ex-\npenses increased ¥11,681 million to ¥368,232 \nmillion.

Extraordinary losses \ndecreased ¥82,975 million to ¥145,413 million, \nmainly due to a decrease in impairment losses.\nAs a result, loss before income taxes totaled \n¥137,563 million, compared to loss before in-\ncome taxes of ¥239,043 million in the previous \nfiscal year.\nLoss attributable to owners of parent \namounted ¥149,980 million compared to loss \nattributable to owners of parent of ¥260,840 \nmillion in the previous fiscal year.\nLoss per share of common stock was ¥230.99.\nSegment Information\n<Brand Businesses>\n[Smart Life & Energy]\nSales decreased 7.4% year on year to ¥441,315 \nmillion. Sales in the white goods business de-\ncreased despite strong air conditioner sales \nsupported by the launch of a new plant in \nIndonesia. This decrease was mainly due to slug-\ngish market conditions for cooking appliances, \nvacuum cleaners, and washing machines. Sales \ndecreased in the energy solutions business due \nto a downturn in the EPC business stemming \nfrom market conditions, despite steady growth \nin the domestic market for residential uses. \nSegment income decreased 6.8% year on year \nto ¥27,373 million, mainly due to lower sales \nand the impact of the weakening yen.\n[Smart Office]\nSales increased 3.6% to ¥582,003 million. Sales \nin the business solutions business increased. \nAlthough sales of information displays declined \nas a result of our efforts to reduce distribution \ninventories, the MFP and office solutions busi-\nnesses grew significantly, particularly in Europe \nand the Americas. This growth was mainly due \nto a recovery in office demand. An expanded \nshare in corporate and government sectors in \nJapan drove sales growth in the PC business, de-\nspite weak market conditions. Segment income \nincreased 104.3% year on year to ¥29,674 \nmillion.

In the TV business, sales decreased de-\nspite progress in the sales of high value-added \nmodels.

Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n(a) Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of Sharp Corporation (“the Company”) have been \nprepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange \nAct and its related accounting regulations and in conformity with accounting principles generally \naccepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and \ndisclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).\nThe financial statements of the Company’s overseas consolidated subsidiaries for consolidation \npurposes have been prepared in conformity with IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles in the \nUnited States of America (“US GAAP”), with adjustments for the specified five items where applicable \naccording to Practical Issues Task Force No. 18 “Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies \nApplied to Foreign Subsidiaries for Consolidated Financial Statements”.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated into English (with no \nreclassifications) from the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance \nwith Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as \nrequired by the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.\nIn preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes, Japanese yen figures less \nthan one million yen have been rounded down to the nearest million yen. Therefore, total or subtotal \namounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are not \nnecessarily equal to the sum of individually presented amounts.\n(b) Principles of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 116 \ncompanies over which the Company has power of control through the holding of majority voting rights \nor with the existence of other certain conditions. Investments in 1 nonconsolidated subsidiary and 12 \naffiliates on which the Company has significant influence regarding their operating and financial policies \nare accounted for using equity method.\nChanges in the consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(Included in scope)\nSHARP FRONTIER ELECTRONICS DEVICE PTE. LTD. (company name changed from FIT ELECTRONICS \nDEVICE PTE. LTD. on July 27, 2023)\nAnd 4 others\n(Excluded from scope)\nKantatsu Co., Ltd.\nAnd 6 others\nChanges in the nonconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for using equity method for the \nfiscal year ended March 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(Excluded from scope)\nFIT ELECTRONICS DEVICE PTE. LTD\nAnd 3 others\nSharp India Ltd. is the main nonconsolidated subsidiary.\nSharp Tokusen Industry Co., Ltd. is the main nonconsolidated subsidiary not accounted for using \nequity method.\n(c) Investment securities\nOther securities\nSecurities other than shares with no available market prices\nValued at fair market value (All valuation differences are directly charged or credited to net assets, with \nthe cost of sales calculated primarily using the periodic average method.)\nShares with no available market prices\nValued primarily by the periodic average method.\nRegarding the investments in partnerships, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries recognize \ntheir share in the profits or losses resulting from the operations of the partnerships as non-operating \nincome or expenses, and reflect such income or expenses to the balance of investment securities.\n(d) Derivative financial instruments\nDerivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.\n(e) Inventories\nInventories held by the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries are primarily measured \nat moving average cost. Inventories are written down when their profitability decreases. Inventories \nheld by overseas consolidated subsidiaries are measured at the lower of moving average cost and net \nrealizable value.\n(f) Depreciation and amortization\nFor the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation of property, plant and \nequipment other than leased assets and right-of-use assets is computed by the declining-balance method.\nMeanwhile, machinery and equipment at the LCD plants in Mie and Kameyama and a part of the \nSakai Plant are depreciated by the straight-line method.\nBuildings (excluding facilities attached to buildings) acquired on or after April 1, 1998, and facilities \nattached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016 are depreciated by the straight-\nline method.\nProperty, plant and equipment at overseas consolidated subsidiaries are depreciated by the straight- \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nSharp Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n35\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nline method.\nAmortization of intangible assets (excluding leased assets) is computed by the straight-line method.\nSoftware used in-house is amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of \nprincipally 5 years, and software embedded in products is amortized over the forecasted sales quantity.\nDepreciation of leased assets related to finance lease transactions that transfer ownership is computed \nby the same method as applied to non-current assets owned by the Company.\nDepreciation of "}

Additionally, the expected costs for individual cases are also accrued.\n(j) Provision for loss from litigation\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries accrue the estimated amount deemed to be necessary for \npossible future losses from lawsuits.\n(k) Provision for sales promotion expenses\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries accrue sales promotion expenses based on estimated \namounts to be paid to agencies and dealers in the subsequent period in respect of revenue recorded by \nthe balance sheet date.\n(l) Provision for restructuring\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries accrue the estimated amounts of restructuring to prepare \nfor future expenses related to structural reform.\n(m) Defined benefit pension plan\nThe estimated amount of defined benefit pension plans to be paid at future retirement dates is allocated \nto each service year based on the plan’s benefit formula.\nPast service costs are amortized primarily by the straight-line method over the average remaining \nservice period of employees (9 years) commencing from the current period. Actuarial gains and losses are \nprimarily amortized by the straight-line method over the average remaining service period of employees \n(9 years) commencing from the period following that in which the gain or loss was incurred.\n(n) Major recognition criteria for revenues and expenses\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“the Group”) recognize revenue based on the following \nfive-step approach.\nStep 1: Identify a contract with customer\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when the Group satisfies a performance obligation\nDetails of the main performance obligations related to revenue from contracts with customers in the \nGroup’s key businesses and the point of time when such performance obligations are typically satisfied \n(the point of time when revenues are usually recognized) are as follows.\nThe Group manufactures and sells telecommunications equipment, electrical equipment and electronic \napplication equipment, and electronic components. In principle, revenue from these transactions is \nrecognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of products delivered by the Group \nas the performance obligation is deemed to have been satisfied by then. At that point in time, the legal \ntitle to the products, physical possession, and significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products \nare transferred to the customer, and the Group is entitled to receive payment for the transaction. For \nsome domestic sales, revenue is recognized upon shipment if the period of time from the shipment to \nthe completion of the transfer of control of the products to the customer is considered to be normal.\nThe Group is also engaged in contracted construction in addition to maintenance and warranty \nservices that are mainly related to products. In these transactions, the Group transfers goods or services \nto customers over time to satisfy performance obligations.

In these transactions, the Group transfers goods or services \nto customers over time to satisfy performance obligations. Thus, in principle, revenue is recognized \naccording to the degree of progress towards complete satisfaction or over time for the service period.\nRevenue is measured in the amount of consideration that the Group expects to be entitled in return \nfor the transfer of products or services to the customers (hereinafter, “transaction price”). In determining \nSharp Annual Report 2024\n36\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\na transaction price, if the consideration promised with the customer includes a variable component \n(hereinafter, “variable consideration”), the transaction price is estimated by subtracting any variable \nconsiderations. The amount of a variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the \nextent that it is highly probable that the subsequent resolution of uncertainty concerning the amount \nof the variable consideration will not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized \nuntil then.\nWhen multiple performance obligations, such as product and warranty services, are identifiable in a \ncontract, a transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation primarily based on the ratio of \nobservable stand-alone selling prices.\nIf a product warranty provides a customer with a service beyond the assurance that the product \ncomplies with agreed-upon specifications, it is treated as a separate performance obligation. A portion \nof the transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation and revenue is recognized over the \nextended warranty period.\nThe Group determines whether it acts as a principal or an agent in a transaction based on whether the \nGroup controls the promised product or service before transferring to the customer. When the Group is \ndeemed to be involved as an agent, the Group recognizes revenue at the net amount of consideration \nthat the Group retains after paying the other party the consideration received in exchange for goods or \nservices to be provided by that party.\nConsiderations for transactions related to the sale of products, etc., contracted construction, and the \nprovision of warranty or other services are usually received within approximately one year from the time \neach performance obligation is satisfied. The Group applies the exemption rule to these contracts, and \nno adjustments for financing components have been made.\n(o) Significant hedge accounting methods\n(1) Deferred and other hedge accounting methods\nThe Company uses deferred hedge accounting for foreign exchange forward contracts for certain \nconsolidated subsidiaries and interest rate swaps of the Company. The allocation method is used for \nforeign exchange forward contracts that meet the requirements for the allocation method, and special \naccounting is used for interest rate swaps that meet the requirements for special accounting.\n(2) Hedging instruments and hedged items\na. Hedging instrument: Foreign exchange forward contracts\nHedged items: Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (mainly receivables and \npayables related to export and import transactions)\nb. Hedging instrument: interest rate swaps\nHedged items: Borrowings with variable interest rates\n(3) Hedging policy\nForeign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge the exchange rate fluctuation risks associated \nwith assets and liabilities in accordance with the Company’s internal rules or the basic rules established \nunder the Company’s guidance. Furthermore, the Company uses interest rate swaps in order to hedge \nthe interest rate fluctuation risks associated with borrowings from financial institutions.\n(4) Method for evaluating hedge effectiveness\nAn evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted because the major conditions of the hedging \ninstruments and the hedged items are consistent and the market fluctuations or cash flow fluctuations \nare assumed to be completely offset at the time of commencement of the hedge and thereafter on \nan ongoing basis.\n(p) Method and period for amortization of goodwill\nGoodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over the expected life. Goodwill recorded in the \nconsolidated subsidiaries in the U.S.A. is amortized by the straight-line method over 10 years.\nHowever, if the amount of goodwill is insignificant, the entire amount is amortized during the fiscal \nyear in which the goodwill arises.\n(q) Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows\nCash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows comprise cash on hand, demand \ndeposits in banks, and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or \nless for which the risks of fluctuations in value are not considered to be significant.\n(r) Major accounting estimates\n(1) Valuation of inventories\ni)  Amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 were \nas follows:\nYen (millions)\n2023 2024\nInventories ¥ 299,307 ¥ 269,584\nii) Information related to the contents of major accounting estimates for identified items\nThe Group reduces the book value of inventories when the n"}

In addition, some inventories deemed slow-moving for more than a certain period of time are \ndevalued regularly over time, assuming that it becomes less possible for those inventories to be sold. \nMoreover, the book value of some inventories is also devalued individually when they are deemed \ndifficult to sell.\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n37\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nHowever, it may become necessary to record further devaluation in the consolidated financial \nstatements in the next fiscal year or onward if the Group faces disadvantageous situations such as \nprice declines resulting from unpredictable environment changes in the future.\n(2) Impairment losses on non-current assets\ni)  Amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 were \nas follows:\nYen (millions)\n2023 2024\nProperty, plant and equipment ¥ 389,257 ¥ 280,123\nIntangible assets 35,845 31,080\nInvestment securities 216,207 238,581\nii) Information related to the contents of major accounting estimates for identified items\nThe Group conducts an impairment test of an asset or asset group, when there is an indication of \nimpairment such as continued operating loss or negative cash flow from operating activities, and if the \nbook value exceeds the higher of its value in use and its net realizable value, the Company recognizes \nimpairment loss for the excess. The future business plan, which forms the basis for calculating the \nvalue in use, is established in consideration of information available at the time of financial closing, \nsuch as market prices and demand outlook provided by external information research companies. \nAdditionally, the net realizable value is determined by reasonable approaches such as asset valuation \nby a third party.\nHowever, the Group may record additional impairment losses in the consolidated financial \nstatements in the next fiscal year or thereafter, when the assumptions in the business plan, such as \nthe market environments, change in the future.\nAdditionally, investment securities of ¥238,581 million recorded in the fiscal year ended March \n31, 2024 include investments in equity-method affiliates of ¥103,157 million. If the equity-method \naffiliates recognize impairment losses in the next fiscal year or thereafter, the Group may recognize the \nshare of loss of entities accounted for using equity method in the consolidated financial statements.\n(3) Matters related to long-term electricity and other supply contracts\nAs stated in “(d) Contingent liabilities” in “2. Notes to Consolidated Balance Sheets” in “Consolidated \nFinancial Statements, etc.,” the Company entered into long-term contracts with several suppliers \nwith respect to electricity and other forms of input at the Sakai plant.

Some notes and accounts receivable \nare denominated in foreign currencies because the Company conducts business globally and, therefore, \nare exposed to foreign currency risks. Notes and accounts payable - trade and electronically recorded \nobligations - operating are due within one year. Some notes and accounts payable arising from the \nimport of raw materials, etc. are denominated in foreign currencies and, therefore, are exposed to foreign \ncurrency risks. The Company makes use of forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency \nrisk exposure on the net position of foreign currency denominated notes and accounts receivable and \nnotes and accounts payable.\nOther securities are held for long term to develop better business alliances and relationships with the \nCompany’s customers and suppliers, and are exposed to market price fluctuation risks. The main purpose \nof long-term borrowings is to procure funds necessary for capital investments. The longest repayment \nterm is 13 years and 4 months from March 31, 2024.\nDerivative transactions consist primarily of forward exchange contracts, which are used to hedge \nforeign currency risk exposure, and interest rate swaps to hedge against the risk of fluctuations in \ninterest rates on borrowings. For hedging instruments, hedged items, hedging policies and assessment \nmethods of effectiveness of hedging instruments, see “(o) Significant hedge accounting methods” in “1. \nSummary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies.”\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n50\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(3) Risk management of financial instruments\ni) Management of credit risks\nFor notes and accounts receivable, the Finance Division and Accounting Division of Finance \nand Administration Office of the Company periodically reviews the status of its key customers, \nmonitoring their respective payment deadlines and remaining outstanding. The Company strives \nto recognize and reduce the risks of irrecoverability as a result of deteriorating financial conditions \nor other factors at an early stage. The Company’s consolidated subsidiaries also follow the same \nmonitoring and administration process.\nii) Management of market risks\nThe Company decides basic policies for derivative transactions at the Foreign Exchange \nAdministration Committee meeting and the Finance Administration Committee meeting which \nare required to be held monthly by the Company’s internal policy. The Finance Division of Finance \nand Administration Office executes transactions and reports the results of such transactions to the \nAccounting Division of Finance and Administration Office on a daily basis. The Accounting Division \nhas set up a specialized section for monitoring transaction results and position management and \nreports the results of transactions to the head of Finance and Administration Office on a daily basis.\nIn addition, the Finance Division reports the results of transactions to the Foreign Exchange \nAdministration Committee and the Finance Administration Committee on a monthly basis. The \nconsolidated subsidiaries also manage forward foreign exchange transactions in accordance with \nthe rules established by the Company and report the content of such transactions to the Company \non a monthly basis.\nFor other securities and investments in capital, the Company monitors their fair values and the \nissuers’ financial positions, and continually reviews the need to increase or decrease the holdings \nof such financial instruments based on the factors mentioned above as well as the relationship \nwith the issuers.\niii) Management of liquidity risks in financing activities\nThe Finance Division manages liquidity risks by preparing and updating cash management plans \nbased on reports from each department and by maintaining liquidity on hand.\n(4) Supplementary explanation of fair value, etc. of financial instruments\nSince variable factors are incorporated into the estimation of the fair value of financial instruments, the \nvalue may fluctuate when different assumptions are adopted.\nThe contract amounts regarding the derivative transactions are shown in “10.

At that point in time, the legal title to the products, physical possession, and significant \nrisks and rewards of the ownership of the products are transferred to the customer, and the Group is \nentitled to receive payment for the transaction. For some domestic sales, revenue is recognized upon \nshipment if the period of time from the shipment to the transfer of control of the products to the \ncustomer is considered to be normal.\nRevenue is measured at the amount of consideration that the Group expects to be entitled (hereinafter, \n“transaction price”) in return for transfer of products or services to customers. The Group deducts \nsales rebates paid primarily to retailers from revenue. In this way, in determining a transaction price, \nif the consideration promised to the customer includes a variable component (hereinafter, “variable \nconsideration”), the transaction price is estimated by subtracting any variable considerations. The amount \nof a variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable \nthat the subsequent resolution of uncertainty concerning the amount of the variable consideration will \nnot result in a significant reversal in revenue.\nIn addition, the Group has product warranty obligations under product sales agreements to repair \nor replace defective products free of charge within a certain period of time. Such warranty obligations \nprovide assurance to the customer that the product will perform as intended in accordance with the \nspecifications set forth in the agreement with the customer, and are therefore recognized as a provision \nfor product warranties.\n(2) Construction contracts\nIn the Energy Solutions business (“Other” in the Smart Life & Energy segment), the Group enters into \nconstruction contracts that include design and construction of solar power plants. In such contracts, the \nperformance obligation is deemed to be satisfied over time as the construction progresses, and revenue is \nrecognized according to the degree of progress made in satisfying that performance obligation. The degree \nof progress is measured by the Input method, which uses the ratio of the cost incurred to the estimated \ntotal cost of each contract.\nHowever, for construction contracts that have a very short period of time from the contract \ncommencement date to the date when the performance obligation is expected to be fully satisfied, the \nGroup does not recognize revenue over time, but upon a completion of an acceptance inspection because \nthe performance obligation is deemed to have been satisfied at that point in time.\n(3) Services\nThe Group offers maintenance contracts and product warranty services associated with (1) Product sales \ncontracts and (2) Construction contracts. For maintenance contracts, the Group provides maintenance \nservices over the contract period and recognizes revenue according to the contract period. In some cases, \nan extended warranty contract is concluded as product warranty services, separately from the normal \nproduct warranties provided in accordance with agreed-upon specifications. In such cases, the Group \nrecognizes revenue over the extended warranty period because the performance obligation of the product \nwarranty services is satisfied over time.\n(4) Licensing\nThe Group receives consideration for patent licensing by entering into an agreement that permits a \ncustomer to manufacture or sell the Group’s products or use its technologies.\nRevenue from licensing is recognized over time if the nature of the Group’s promise in granting the \nlicense to the customer is the right to access the intellectual property over the term of the license.

In \nthe event of any discrepancy between the English version and the original Chinese version or any differences in the \ninterpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language auditors’ report and financial statements shall prevail.\n~1~\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT TRANSLATED FROM CHINESE\n \nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd.  \n  \nIntroduction \nWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hon Hai Precision Industry \nCo., Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") as at June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related consolidated \nstatements of comprehensive income for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, \nas well as the consolidated statements of changes in equity and of cash flows for the six months ended \nJune 30, 2025 and 2024, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of \nmaterial accounting policies. Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these \nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of \nFinancial Reports by Securities Issuers and International Accounting Standard 34, \"Interim Financial \nReporting\" that came into effect as endorsed by the Financial Supervisory Commission. Our \nresponsibility is to express a conclusion on these consolidated financial statements based on our reviews.\n     \nScope of review\nExcept as explained in the following paragraph, we conducted our reviews in accordance with the \nStandard on Review Engagements 2410, \"Review of Financial Information Performed by the Independent \nAuditor of the Entity\" of the Republic of China. A review of consolidated financial statements consists of \nmaking inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying \nanalytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit and \nconsequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant \nmatters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\n     \nBasis for qualified conclusion \nAs explained in Notes 4(3) and 6(10), the financial statements of certain insignificant consolidated \nsubsidiaries and investments accounted for using equity method were not reviewed by independent \nauditors. Those statements reflect total assets (including investments accounted for using equity method) \nof NT$303,911,239 thousand and NT$376,748,117 thousand, constituting 7.34% and 9.50% of the \nconsolidated total assets, and total liabilities of NT$64,405,313 thousand and NT$46,694,070 thousand, \nconstituting 2.57% and 2.08% of the consolidated total liabilities as at June 30, 2025 and 2024 \nrespectively, and the total comprehensive income (loss) (including share of profit (loss) and other \ncomprehensive income of associates and joint ventures accounted for using equity method) of \n(NT$7,227,763) thousand, NT$1,164,482 thousand, NT$3,697,874 thousand and (NT$9,377,797) \nthousand, constituting 3.65%, 2.23%, 3.22% and 7.22% of the consolidated total comprehensive income \nfor the three months and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These amounts and the \ninformation disclosed in Note 13 were based solely on the unreviewed financial statements of these \ncompanies as at June 30, 2025 and 2024.\nQualified conclusion \nBased on our reviews and the review reports of other auditors as described in Other matter  \nsection, except for the adjustments to the consolidated financial statements, if any, as might have been \n~2~\ndetermined to be necessary had the financial statements of certain insignificant consolidated subsidiaries, \ninvestments accounted for using the equity method and the information disclosed in Note 13 been \nreviewed by independent auditors as described in the Basis for qualified conclusion  section above, \nnothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying consolidated financial \nstatements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group \nas at June 30, 2025 and 2024, and of its consolidated financial performance for the three months and six \nmonths ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 and its consolidated cash flows for the six months ended June 30, \n2025 and 2024 in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by \nSecurities Issuers and International Accounting Standard 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\" that came into \neffect as endorsed by the Financial Supervisory Commission.\nOther matter-Review Reports By Other Independent Auditors\nWe did not review the financial statements of certain consolidated subsidiaries.

Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, ‘Amendments to the classification and measurement \nof financial instruments’ \nThe IASB issued the amendments to: \n(a) Clarify the date of recognition and derecognition of some financial assets and \nliabilities, with a new exception relating to the derecognition of a financial liability (or \npart of a financial liability) settled through an electronic cash transfer system. \nApplying the exception, an entity is permitted to derecognise a financial liability at an \nearlier date if, and only if, the entity has initiated a payment instruction and specific \nconditions are met. The conditions for the exception are that the entity making the \npayment does not have: \ni. the practical ability to withdraw, stop or cancel the payment instruction;\nii. the practical ability to access the cash used for settlement; and\niii.significant settlement risk.\n(b) Clarify and add further guidance for assessing whether a financial asset meets the \nsolely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criterion, covering contractual terms \nthat can change cash flows based on contingent events (for example, interest rates \nlinked to such as some instruments with features linked to the achievement of \nenvironment, social and governance (ESG) targets), non-recourse features and \ncontractually-linked instruments. \n(c) Add new disclosures for certain instruments with contractual terms that can change \ncash flows (such as some instruments with features linked to the achievement of ESG \ntargets), including a qualitative description of the nature of the contingent event, \nquantitative information about the possible changes to contractual cash flows that \ncould result from those contractual terms and the gross carrying amount of financial \nassets and amortised cost of financial liabilities subject to these contractual terms. \n(d) Update the disclosures for equity instruments designated at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income (FVOCI). The entity shall disclose the fair value of each class \nof investment and is no longer required to disclose the fair value of each investment. \nIn addition, the amendments require the entity to disclose the fair value gain or loss \npresented in other comprehensive income during the period, showing separately the \nfair value gain or loss related to investments derecognised during the reporting period \nand the fair value gain or loss related to investments held at the end of the reporting \nperiod and any transfers of the cumulative gain or loss within equity during the \nreporting period related to the investments derecognised during that reporting period.\n~12~\nB. Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, ‘Contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity’\nThe amendments apply to contracts that expose an entity to variability in the underlying \namount of electricity because the source of electricity generation depends on \nuncontrollable natural conditions (such as the weather). These amendments include:\n(a) Clarifying the application of the ‘own use’ requirements for contracts to buy or sell \nnature dependent electricity:\nWhen the contract requires an entity to buy and take delivery of electricity when it is \ngenerated, and the design and operation of the market in which the electricity is \ntransacted under the contract require the entity to sell any amounts of unused \nelectricity within a specified time, the entity shall consider reasonable and supportable \ninformation regarding its past, current and expected future electricity transactions \nwithin a reasonable amount of time not exceeding 12 months.

These amendments include:\n(a) Clarifying the application of the ‘own use’ requirements for contracts to buy or sell \nnature dependent electricity:\nWhen the contract requires an entity to buy and take delivery of electricity when it is \ngenerated, and the design and operation of the market in which the electricity is \ntransacted under the contract require the entity to sell any amounts of unused \nelectricity within a specified time, the entity shall consider reasonable and supportable \ninformation regarding its past, current and expected future electricity transactions \nwithin a reasonable amount of time not exceeding 12 months. An entity is considered \na ‘net purchaser’ if it buys sufficient electricity to offset any sales of unused electricity \nin the same market in which the entity sold the electricity.\nAn entity applying these amendments to own use contracts referencing nature-\ndependent electricity shall disclose the following:\ni. Variability in the underlying amount of basic electricity and the risk that the entity \nwould be required to buy electricity during a delivery interval in which it cannot \nuse the electricity;\nii. Unrecognised contract commitments, including the expected future cash flows from \nbuying electricity under these contracts; and\niii.The effects of the contracts on the entity’s financial performance for the reporting \nperiod.\n(b) Permitting hedge accounting if these contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity \nare used as hedging instruments:\nAn entity is permitted to designate as the hedged item a variable nominal amount of \nforecast electricity transactions that is aligned with the variable amount of nature-\ndependent electricity expected to be delivered by the generation facility as referenced \nin the hedging instrument. Additionally, if the cash flows of the contract referencing \nnature-dependent electricity designated as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge \nrelationship are conditional on the occurrence of a forecast transaction, the forecast \ntransaction is presumed to be highly probable.\nFor entities that designate contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity as \nhedging instruments, the terms and conditions of such hedging instruments shall be \ndisclosed according to risk categories in compliance with IFRS 7.\n~13~\n(3) IFRS issued by IASB but not yet endorsed by the FSC\nNew standards, interpretations and amendments issued by IASB but not yet included in the \nIFRS as endorsed by the FSC are as follows:\n New Standards, Interpretations and Amendments\nEffective date by\nIASB\nAmendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28, ‘Sale or contribution of \nassets between an investor and its associate or joint venture’\nTo be determined by\nIASB\nIFRS 18, ‘Presentation and disclosure in financial statements’ January 1, 2027\nIFRS 19, ‘Subsidiaries without public accountability: disclosures’ January 1, 2027\nExcept for the following, the above standards and interpretations have no significant impact to \nthe Group’s financial condition and financial performance based on the Group’s assessment.\nIFRS 18, ‘Presentation and disclosure in financial statements’\nIFRS 18, ‘Presentation and disclosure in financial statements’ replaces IAS 1. The standard \nintroduces a defined structure of the statement of profit or loss, disclosure requirements \nrelated to management-defined performance measures, and enhanced principles on \naggregation and disaggregation which apply to the primary financial statements and notes.\n4.

The areas involving a higher degree of \njudgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the \nconsolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 5.\n(3) Basis of consolidation\nA. Basis for preparation of consolidated financial statements:\n(a)All subsidiaries are included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. \nSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) controlled by the Group. The \nGroup controls an entity when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns \nfrom its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its \npower over the entity. Consolidation of subsidiaries begins from the date the Group \nobtains control of the subsidiaries and ceases when the Group loses control of the \nsubsidiaries.\n(b)Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions \nbetween companies within the Group are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries \nhave been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by \nthe Group.\n(c)Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the \nowners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income is \nattributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this \nresults in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n(d)Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the parent \nlosing control of the subsidiary (transactions with non-controlling interests) are \naccounted for as equity transactions, i.e. transactions with owners in their capacity as \nowners. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are \nadjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in \nequity.\n(e)When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the Group remeasures any investment \nretained in the former subsidiary at its fair value. That fair value is regarded as the fair \nvalue on initial recognition of a financial asset or the cost on initial recognition of the \nassociate or joint venture. Any difference between fair value and carrying amount is \nrecognised in profit or loss. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive \nincome in relation to the subsidiary should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss or \ntransferred to retained earnings as specified by applicable IFRSs.\n~15~\nB.

In addition, if the Group \n~25~\nstill retains partial interest in the former foreign associate after losing significant \ninfluence over the former foreign associate, such transactions should be accounted for as \ndisposal of all interest in these foreign operations.\n(c)When the foreign operation partially disposed of or sold is a subsidiary, cumulative \nexchange differences that were recorded in other comprehensive income are \nproportionately transferred to the non-controlling interest in this foreign operation.

The objective of the Group’s business model is achieved both by collecting contractual \ncash flows and selling financial assets.\nb.

Financial assets at amortised cost are those that meet all of the following criteria:\n(a)The objective of the Group’s business model is achieved by collecting contractual cash \nflows.\n(b)The assets’ contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n~27~\nB. On a regular way purchase or sale basis, financial assets at amortised cost are recognised \nand derecognised using trade date accounting.\nC. At initial recognition, the Group measures the financial assets at fair value plus transaction \ncosts. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the \neffective interest method. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is \nderecognised or impaired.\nD. The Group’s time deposits which do not fall under cash equivalents are those with a short \nmaturity period and are measured at initial investment amount as the effect of discounting \nis immaterial.\n(10) Accounts and notes receivable\nA. Accounts and notes receivable entitle the Group a legal right to receive consideration in \nexchange for transferred goods or rendered services.\nB. The short-term accounts and notes receivable without bearing interest are subsequently \nmeasured at initial invoice amount as the effect of discounting is immaterial.\nC. The Group’s operating pattern of accounts receivable that are expected to be factored is for \nthe purpose of receiving contract cash flow and selling, and the accounts receivable are \nsubsequently measured at fair value, with any changes in fair value recognised in other \ncomprehensive income.\n(11) Impairment of financial assets\nFor debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial \nassets at amortised cost including accounts receivable that have a significant financing \ncomponent, at each reporting date, the Group recognises the impairment provision for 12 \nmonths expected credit losses if there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since \ninitial recognition or recognises the impairment provision for the lifetime expected credit \nlosses (ECLs) if such credit risk has increased since initial recognition after taking into \nconsideration all reasonable and verifiable information that includes forecasts. On the other \nhand, for accounts receivable or contract assets that do not contain a significant financing \ncomponent, the Group recognises the impairment provision for lifetime ECLs.\n(12) Derecognition of financial assets\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when one of the following conditions is met:\nA. The contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the financial asset expire.\nB. The contractual rights to receive cash flows of the financial asset have been transferred and \nthe Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial \nasset.\nC. The contractual rights to receive cash flows of the financial asset have been transferred; \nand the Group has not retained control of the financial asset.\n(13) Leasing arrangement (lessor) – Lease receivables / Operating leases\nA. Based on the terms of a lease contract, a lease is classified as a finance lease if the lessee \n~28~\nassumes substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset.\n(a) At commencement of the lease term, the lessor should record a finance lease in the \nbalance sheet as ‘lease receivables’ at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease \n(including initial direct costs). The difference between gross lease receivable and the \npresent value of the receivable is recognised as ‘unearned finance income of finance \nlease’.\n(b) The lessor should allocate finance income over the lease term based on a systematic and \nrational basis reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment \nin the finance lease.\n(c) Lease payments (excluding costs for services) during the lease term are applied against \nthe gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and the unearned finance \nincome.\nB. Lease income from an operating lease (net of any incentives given to the lessee) is \nrecognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n(14) Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the \nweighted-average method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw \nmaterials, direct labor, other direct costs and related production overheads (allocated based on \nnormal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. The item by item approach is used in \napplying the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling \nprice in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the \nestimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n(15) Non-current assets held for sale \nNon-current assets are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be \nrecovered principally through a sale transaction rather than t"}

Lease income from an operating lease (net of any incentives given to the lessee) is \nrecognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n(14) Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling \nprice in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the \nestimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n(15) Non-current assets held for sale \nNon-current assets are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be \nrecovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and a sale \nis considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value \nless costs to sell. \n(16) Investments accounted for under the equity method / associates\nA. Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. In \ngeneral, it is presumed that the investor has significant influence, if an investor holds, \ndirectly or indirectly 20 percent or more of the voting power of the investee. Investments in \nassociates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.\nB. The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit \nor loss, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is \nrecognised in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in an \nassociate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured \nreceivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or \nconstructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\nC. When changes in an associate’s equity do not arise from profit or loss or other \n~29~\ncomprehensive income of the associate and such changes do not affect the Group’s \nownership percentage of the associate, the Group recognises change in ownership interests \nin the associate in ‘capital surplus’ in proportion to its ownership.\nD. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the \nextent of the Group’s interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless \nthe transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting \npolicies of associates have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the \npolicies adopted by the Group.\nE. In the case that an associate issues new shares and the Group does not subscribe or acquire \nnew shares proportionately, which results in a change in the Group’s ownership percentage \nof the associate but maintains significant influence on the associate, then ‘capital surplus’ \nand ‘investments accounted for under the equity method’ shall be adjusted for the increase \nor decrease of its share of equity interest. If the above condition causes a decrease in the \nGroup’s ownership percentage of the associate, in addition to the above adjustment, the \namounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate \nare reclassified to profit or loss proportionately on the same basis as would be required if \nthe relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of or transferred. The amounts previously \nrecognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate are directly \ntransferred to retained earnings proportionately on the same basis if the relevant assets or \nliabilities were disposed of and transferred to retained earnings directly according to the \nrequirements in IFRSs.\nF. Upon loss of significant influence over an associate, the Group remeasures any investment \nretained in the former associate at its fair value. Any difference between fair value and \ncarrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.\nG. When the Group disposes its investment in an associate and loses significant influence over \nthis associate, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in \nrelation to the associate, are reclassified to profit or loss, on the same basis as would be \nrequired if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of or the amounts previously \nrecognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate are directly \ntransferred to retained earnings on the same basis if the relevant assets or liabilities were \ndisposed of and transferred to retained earnings directly according to the requirements in \nIFRSs. If it retains significant influence over this associate, the amounts previously \nrecognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate are reclassified to \nprofit or loss proportionately in accordance with the aforementioned approach.\nH. When the Group disposes its investment in an associate and loses significant influence over \nthis associate, the amounts previously recognised as capital surplus in relation to the \nassociate are transferred to profit or loss. If it retains significant influence over this \nassociate, the amounts previously recognised as capital surplus in relation to the associate \nare transferred to profit or loss proportionately.\n(17)  Investment accounted for using equity method- joint ventures \n~30~\nThe Group accounts for its interest in a joint venture using equity method.

Unrealised profits \nand losses arising from the transactions between the Group and its joint venture are eliminated \nto the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture. However, when the transaction \nprovides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment \nloss, all such losses shall be recognised immediately. When the Group’s share of losses in a \njoint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture together with any other \nunsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal \nor constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\n(18) Property, plant and equipment\nA. Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Borrowing costs incurred \nduring the construction period are capitalised.\nB. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate \nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with \nthe item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The \ncarrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are \ncharged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.\nC. While land is not depreciated, other property, plant and equipment that apply cost model \nare depreciated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost over their estimated \nuseful lives. Each component of property, plant and equipment that is significant in relation \nto the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.\nD. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and \nadjusted if appropriate, at each financial year-end. If expectations for the assets’ residual \nvalues and useful lives differ from previous estimates or the patterns of consumption of the \nassets’ future economic benefits embodied in the assets have changed significantly, any \nchange is recognised as a change in estimate under IAS 8, ‘Accounting Policies, Changes \nin Accounting Estimates and Errors’, from the date of the change. The estimated useful \nlives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\nBuildings 15 ~ 51 years \n( Auxiliary buildings 5 ~ 11 years )\nMachinery and equipment 3  ～  9  y e a r s  \nComputer and communication equipment 3  ～  2 5  y e a r s\nOther equipment 1  ～  2 5  y e a r s\n(19) L e a s i n g  a r r a n g e m e n t s  ( l e s s e e ) － r i g h t - o f - u s e  a s s e t s  /  l e a s e  l i a b i l i t i e s\nA. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date \nat which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. For short-term leases or leases \nof low-value assets, lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis \nover the lease term.\nB. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the remaining lease payments at the \ncommencement date, discounted using the incremental borrowing interest rate. Lease \n~31~\npayments are comprised of the following:\n(a)Fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;\n(b)Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate;\n(c)Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n(d)The exercise price of a purchase option, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that \noption; and\n(e)Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee \nexercising that option.\nThe Group subsequently measures the lease liability at amortised cost using the interest \nmethod and recognises interest expense over the lease term. The lease liability is \nremeasured and the amount of remeasurement is recognised as an adjustment to the right-of-\nuse asset when there are changes in the lease term or lease payments and such changes do \nnot arise from contract modifications.\nC. At the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is stated at cost comprising the following:\n(a)The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n(b)Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date;\n(c)Any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and\n(d)An estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the \nunderlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset \nto the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.\nThe right-of-use asset is measured subsequently using the cost model and is depreciated \nfrom the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the asset’s useful life or the end of \nthe lease term. When the lease liability is remeasured, the amount of remeasurement is \nrecognised as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.\nD. For lease modifications that decrease the scope of the lease, the lessee shall decrease the \ncarrying amount of the right-of-use asset and remeasure the lease l"}

For all \nother lease modifications, the lessee shall remeasure the lease liability and adjust the right-\nof-use asset, correspondingly.\n(20) Investment property\nAn investment property is stated initially at its cost and measured subsequently using the cost \nmodel. Investment property is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life \nof 6 to 51 years.\n(21) Intangible assets\nA. Trademark and brand are amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of \n3 to 20 years. \nB. Goodwill is generated by adopting the acquisition method when merger and acquisition \noccurs. \n~32~\nC. Patent is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of 2 to 20 years.\nD. The developed technologies are obtained from business combination and the capital \ncontribution in the form of technology. They included application technology such as home \nnetworking, Internet of Things, model platforms and electric vehicle power systems. If the \ndeveloped technologies are available for use, they will be amortised on a straight-line basis \nover its estimated useful life of 4 to 10 years or using the units of production method. The \nremaining developed technologies that are not yet available for use will be tested annually \nfor impairment and amortised when they are available for use.\nE. Customer relationship are obtained as a result of a business combination and are amortised \non a straight-line basis over its estimated life of 5 to 12 years.\nF. Software is stated initially at its costs and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its \nestimated useful life of 2 to 10 years.\nG. Internally generated intangible assets—research and development expenditures\n(a)Research expenditures are recognised as an expense as incurred.\n(b)Development expenditures that do not meet the following criteria are recognised as \nexpenses as incurred, but are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria \nare met:\ni. It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for \nuse or sale;\nii. An entity intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;\niii.An entity has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\niv. It can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future \neconomic benefits;\nv. Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to \nuse or sell the intangible assets are available; and\nvi. The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be \nreliably measured.\n(c)Upon being available for use, internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a \nstraight-line basis over their estimated useful life.\n(22) Impairment of non-financial assets\nA.The Group assesses at each balance sheet date the recoverable amounts of those assets \nwhere there is an indication that they are impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the \namount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The \nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell or value in use. \nExcept for goodwill, when the circumstances or reasons for recognising impairment loss for \nan asset in prior periods no longer exist or diminish, the impairment loss is reversed. The \nincreased carrying amount due to reversal should not be more than what the depreciated or \namortised historical cost would have been if the impairment had not been recognised.\nB. The recoverable amount of goodwill shall be evaluated annually. An impairment is \nrecognised when recoverable amount is lower than carrying amount. Impairment loss \n~33~\nshould not be reversed in the future.\nC. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is \nallocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that is/are \nexpected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each unit or group of \nunits to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at \nwhich the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored \nat the operating segment level.\n(23) Borrowings\nBorrowings comprise long-term and short-term bank borrowings and other short-term loans. \nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings \nare subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of \ntransaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the period of \nthe borrowings using the effective interest method.\n(24) Notes and accounts payable\nA.

Borrowings \nare subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of \ntransaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the period of \nthe borrowings using the effective interest method.\n(24) Notes and accounts payable\nA. Accounts payable are liabilities for purchases of raw materials, goods or services and notes \npayable are those resulting from operating and non-operating activities.\nB. The short-term notes and accounts payable without bearing interest are subsequently \nmeasured at initial invoice amount as the effect of discounting is immaterial.\n(25) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\nA. Financial liabilities are classified in this category of held for trading if acquired principally \nfor the purpose of repurchasing in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as \nfinancial liabilities held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Financial \nliabilities that meet one of the following criteria are designated as at fair value through \nprofit or loss at initial recognition: \n(a)Hybrid (combined) contracts; or\n(b)They eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency; or\n(c)They are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in \naccordance with a documented risk management policy.\nB. At initial recognition, the Group measures the financial liabilities at fair value. All related \ntransaction costs are recognised in profit or loss. The Group subsequently measures these \nfinancial liabilities at fair value with any gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.\nC. If the credit risk results in fair value changes in financial liabilities designated as at fair \nvalue through profit or loss, they are recognised in other comprehensive income in the \ncircumstances other than avoiding accounting mismatch or recognising in profit or loss for \nloan commitments or financial guarantee contracts.\n(26) Bonds payable\nOrdinary corporate bonds issued by the Group are initially recognised at fair value less \ntransaction costs. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the \n~34~\nredemption value is presented as an addition to or deduction from bonds payable, which is \namortised to profit or loss over the period of bond circulation using the effective interest \nmethod as an adjustment to ‘finance costs’.\n(27) Convertible bonds payable\nConvertible bonds issued by the Group contain conversion options (that is, the bondholders \nhave the right to convert the bonds into the Group’s common shares by exchanging a fixed \namount of cash for a fixed number of common shares), call options and put options. The \nGroup classifies the bonds payable upon issuance as a financial asset, a financial liability or an \nequity instrument in accordance with the contract terms. They are accounted for as follows:\n(a)The host contracts of bonds are initially recognised at fair value. Any difference between \nthe initial recognition and the redemption value is accounted for as the premium or discount \non bonds payable and subsequently is amortised in profit or loss as an adjustment to \n‘finance costs’ over the period of circulation using the effective interest method.\n(b)The exercise price of the embedded put and call options in the convertible bonds issued by \nthe Group is approximately equal to the carrying amount (amortised cost) of the host debt \ninstrument on each exercise date. Therefore, the put and call options are assessed to be \nclosely related to the host debt contract.\n(c)The embedded conversion options which meet the definition of an equity instrument are \ninitially recognised in ‘capital surplus—share options’ at the residual amount of total issue \nprice less the amount of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or \nloss and bonds payable as stated above. Conversion options are not subsequently \nremeasured.\n(d)Any transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance are allocated to each liability or \nequity component in proportion to the initial carrying amount of each abovementioned \nitem.\n(e)When bondholders exercise conversion options, the liability component of the bonds shall \nbe remeasured on the conversion date. The issuance cost of converted common shares is the \ntotal book value of the abovementioned liability component and ‘capital surplus—share \noptions’.\n(28) Derecognition of financial liabilities\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is either \ndischarged or cancelled or expires.\n(29) Offsetting financial instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and reported in the net amount in the balance sheet \nwhen there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an \nintention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n~35~\n(30) Non-hedging and embedded derivatives\nNon-hedging derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract \nis entered into and recorded as financial assets or financial lia"}

At the inception of the hedging relationship, there is formal designation and documentation \nof the hedging relationship and the Group’s risk management objective and strategy for \nundertaking the hedge. That documentation shall include identification of the hedging \ninstrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will \nassess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.\nB. The Group designates the hedging relationship as follows:\nCash flow hedge: a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to \na particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast \ntransaction.\nC. Cash flow hedges\na. The cash flow hedge reserve associated with the hedged item is adjusted to the lower of \nthe following (in absolute amounts):\ni. the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge; \nand \nii.the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge.\nb. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other \ncomprehensive income. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the \nineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.\nc. The amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance \nwith (a) is accounted for as follows:\ni.If a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-\nfinancial asset or non-financial liability, or a hedged forecast transaction for a non-\nfinancial asset or non-financial liability becomes a firm commitment for which fair \nvalue hedge accounting is applied, the Group shall remove that amount from the cash \nflow hedge reserve and include it directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount \nof the asset or liability.\nii.For cash flow hedges other than those covered by i. above, that amount shall be \nreclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification \nadjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future \ncash flows affect profit or loss.\niii.If that amount is a loss and the Group expects that all or a portion of that loss will not \nbe recovered in one or more future periods, it shall immediately reclassify the amount \n~36~\nthat is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.\nd. When the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, exercised or when the \nhedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria, if the forecast transaction is \nstill expected to occur, the amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge \nreserve shall remain in the cash flow hedge reserve until the forecast transaction occurs; \nif the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount shall be \nimmediately reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a \nreclassification adjustment.\n(32) Provisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a \nresult of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required \nto settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions \nare measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the \nobligation on the balance sheet date, which is discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that \nreflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the \nobligation. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to passage of time is \nrecognised as interest expense. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\n(33) Employee benefits\nA. Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits \nexpected to be paid in respect of service rendered by employees in a period and should be \nrecognised as expense in that period when the employees render service.\nB. Pensions\n(a) Defined contribution plans\nFor defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognised as pension expense \nwhen they are due on an accrual basis. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset \nto the extent of a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments.\n(b) Defined benefit plans\ni. Net obligation under a defined benefit plan is defined as the present value of an \namount of pension benefits that employees will receive on retirement for their \nservices with the Group in current period or prior periods.

Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits \nexpected to be paid in respect of service rendered by employees in a period and should be \nrecognised as expense in that period when the employees render service.\nB. Pensions\n(a) Defined contribution plans\nFor defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognised as pension expense \nwhen they are due on an accrual basis. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset \nto the extent of a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments.\n(b) Defined benefit plans\ni. Net obligation under a defined benefit plan is defined as the present value of an \namount of pension benefits that employees will receive on retirement for their \nservices with the Group in current period or prior periods. The liability recognised \nin the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value \nof the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan \nassets. The net defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent \nactuaries using the projected unit credit method. The rate used to discount is \ndetermined by using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are \ndenominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms \nto maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability; when there \n~37~\nis no deep market in high-quality corporate bonds, the Group uses interest rates of \ngovernment bonds (at the balance sheet date) instead.\nii. Remeasurements arising on defined benefit plans are recognised in other \ncomprehensive income in the period in which they arise and are recorded as \nretained earnings.\niii. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\niv. Pension cost for the interim period is calculated on a year-to-date basis by using the \npension cost rate derived from the actuarial valuation at the end of the prior \nfinancial year, adjusted for significant market fluctuations since that time and for \nsignificant curtailments, settlements, or other significant one-off events. Also, the \nrelated information is disclosed accordingly.\nC. Employees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration\nEmployees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration are recognised as expense and \nliability, provided that such recognition is required under legal or constructive obligation \nand those amounts can be reliably estimated. Any difference between the resolved amounts \nand the subsequently actual distributed amounts is accounted for as changes in estimates. If \nemployee compensation is paid by shares, the Group calculates the number of shares based \non the closing price at the previous day of the board meeting resolution.\n(34) Employee share-based payment\nA. For the equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, the employee services received \nare measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the grant date, and are \nrecognised as compensation cost over the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment \nto equity. The fair value of the equity instruments granted shall reflect the impact of market \nvesting conditions and non-vesting conditions. Compensation cost is subject to adjustment \nbased on the service conditions that are expected to be satisfied and the estimates of the \nnumber of equity instruments that are expected to vest under the non-market vesting \nconditions at each balance sheet date. Ultimately, the amount of compensation cost \nrecognised is based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.\nB. Restricted stocks:\na. Restricted stocks issued to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity \ninstruments granted at the grant date, and are recognised as compensation cost over the \nvesting period.\nb. For restricted stocks where those stocks do not restrict distribution of dividends to \nemployees and employees are not required to return the dividends received if they resign \nduring the vesting period, the Group recognises the fair value of the dividends received \nby the employees who are expected to resign during the vesting period as compensation \ncost at the date of dividends declared.\nc. For restricted stocks where employees have to pay to acquire those stocks, if employees \nresign during the vesting period, they must return the stocks to the Group and the Group \nmust refund their payments on the stocks. For restricted stocks issued with consideration \nwith the grant date set on or after October 11, 2024, the Group recognises the payments \nfrom the employees who had paid to acquire the stocks as liabilities at the grant date; For \n~38~\nrestricted stocks issued with consideration with the grant date set on or before October \n10, 2024, the Group recognises the payments from the employees who are expected to \nresign during the vesting period as liabilities at the grant date, and recognises the \npayments from the employees who are expected to be eventually vested with the stocks \nin ’capital surplus – others’.\n(35) Income tax\nA. The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in \nprofit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive \nincome or items recognised directly in equity, in which cases the tax is recognised in other \ncomprehensive income or equity.\nB. The current income tax expense is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or \nsubstantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its \nsubsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in \nprofit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive \nincome or items recognised directly in equity, in which cases the tax is recognised in other \ncomprehensive income or equity.\nB. The current income tax expense is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or \nsubstantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its \nsubsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates \npositions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in accordance with applicable tax \nregulations. It establishes provisions where appropriate based on the amounts expected to \nbe paid to the tax authorities. An additional tax is levied on the unappropriated retained \nearnings and is recognised as income tax expense in the year the stockholders resolve to \nretain the earnings.\nC. Deferred income tax is recognised, using the balance sheets liability method, on temporary \ndifferences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts \nin the consolidated balance sheet. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if \nit arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other \nthan a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting \nnor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary \ndifferences. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on \ninvestments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the \ntemporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary \ndifference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax is determined \nusing tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date \nand are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the \ndeferred income tax liability is settled.\nD. Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future \ntaxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. At \neach balance sheet date, unrecognised and recognised deferred income tax assets are \nreassessed.\nE. Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the \nbalance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and \nthere is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability \nsimultaneously. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset on the balance sheet \nwhen the entity has the legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current \n~39~\ntax liabilities and they are levied by the same taxation authority on either the same entity or \ndifferent entities that intend to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability \nsimultaneously.\nF. A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carryforward of unused tax credits resulting \nfrom acquisitions of equipment or technology, research and development expenditures and \nequity investments to the extent that it is possible that future taxable profit will be available \nagainst which the unused tax credits can be utilised.\nG. The interim period income tax expense is recognised based on the estimated average \nannual effective income tax rate expected for the full financial year applied to the pretax \nincome of the interim period, and the related information is disclosed accordingly.\n(36) Dividends\nDividends are recorded in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which they are \nresolved by the Company’s shareholders. Cash dividends are recorded as liabilities; stock \ndividends are recorded as stock dividends to be distributed and are reclassified to ordinary \nshares on the effective date of new shares issuance.\n(37) Revenue recognition\nA. The Group manufactures and sells consumer electronics products. Sales are recognised \nwhen control of the products have transferred, being when the products are delivered to or \npicked by the customers, the customers have full discretion over the channel and price to \nsell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s \nacceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the \nspecific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customers, \nand either the customers has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, or \nthe Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\nB. Sales revenue is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated \nsales discounts and allowances. Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly \nprobable that a significant reversal will not occur. The estimation is subject to an \nassessment at each reporting date. The contract cost does not include a significant financing \ncomponent as the sales are made with credit term consistent with market practice.\nC.

The contract cost does not include a significant financing \ncomponent as the sales are made with credit term consistent with market practice.\nC. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the \nconsideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the \npayment is due.\nD. The Group’s obligation to provide a refund for faulty products under the standard warranty \nterms is recognised as a provision.\nE. The customer pays at the time specified in the payment schedule. If the products sold \nexceed the payment, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the products \nsold, a contract liability is recognised.\n(38) Government grants\nGovernment grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in \nwhich the Group recognises expenses for the related costs for which the grants are intended to \ncompensate. Government grants related to property, plant and equipment are recognised as \n~40~\nnon-current liabilities and are amortised to profit or loss over the estimated useful lives of the \nrelated assets using the straight-line method.\n(39) Business combinations\nA. The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The \nconsideration transferred for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets \ntransferred, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued at the acquisition \ndate, plus the fair value of any assets and liabilities resulting from a contingent \nconsideration arrangement. All acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. \nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business \ncombination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. For each \nbusiness combination, the Group measures at the acquisition date components of non-\ncontrolling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their \nholders to the proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation at \neither fair value or the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognised \namounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. All other non-controlling interests should \nbe measured at the acquisition-date fair value.\nB. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in \nthe acquiree and the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair \nvalue of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill \nat the acquisition date. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest in \nthe acquiree recognised and the fair value of previously held equity interest in the acquiree \nis less than the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, the \ndifference is recognised directly in profit or loss on the acquisition date.\n(40) Operating segments\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to \nthe chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing \nperformance of the operating segments.\n5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON \nUNCERTAINTY\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical \njudgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies and make critical assumptions and \nestimates concerning future events. Assumptions and estimates may differ from the actual results \nand are continually evaluated and adjusted based on historical experience and other factors. The \nabove information is addressed below:\n(1) Critical judgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies \nA. Revenue recognition\nThe Group determines whether the nature of its performance obligation is to provide the \nspecified goods or services itself (i.e. the Group is a principal) or to arrange for the other \nparty to provide those goods or services (i.e. the Group is an agent) based on the \ntransaction model and its economic substance. The Group is a principal if it controls a \n~41~\npromised good or service before it transfers the good or service to a customer. The Group \nrecognises revenue at gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in \nexchange for those goods or services transferred. The Group is an agent if its performance \nobligation is to arrange for the provision of goods or services by another party. The Group \nrecognises revenue at the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be \nentitled in exchange for arranging for the other party to provide its goods or services.\nAfter receiving the materials or services procured, the Group directs the use of the goods \nand services and provides critical manufacturing processing technique, in order to produce \nand significantly integrate various goods and services into the combined output as the \nresulting devices and transfers to a customer.

The following indicators are used to \ndetermine whether the Group controls the good or service before it is transferred to a \ncustomer and considers itself as a principal:\n(a)The Group is primarily responsible for the provision of goods or services;\n(b)The Group assumes the inventory risk before transferring the specified goods or \nservices to the customer or after transferring control of the goods or services to the \ncustomer.\n(c)The Group has discretion in establishing prices for the goods or services. \nB. Offsetting financial instruments\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported in the net amount in \nthe balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts \nand there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability \nsimultaneously.\n(2) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions based on the expectation of future events that are \nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances at the end of the reporting period. The \nresulting accounting estimates might be different from the actual results. The estimates and \nassumptions that may significantly adjust the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within \nthe next financial year are addressed below:\nA. Impairment assessment of goodwill\nThe Group assesses impairment of goodwill based on subjective judgment which includes \nidentifying and allocating assets, liabilities and goodwill to related cash-generating unit to \ndetermine recoverable amount of this unit. Details of impairment assessment of goodwill \nis provided in Note 6(14).\nAs of June 30, 2025 , the Group recognised goodwill after impairment assessment of  \n$19,540,106.\nB. Impairment assessment of investments accounted for using equity method \nThe Group assesses the impairment of an investment accounted for using equity method \nand the goodwill it contains as soon as there is any indication that it might have been \nimpaired and its carrying amount cannot be recovered. The Group assesses the recoverable \namounts of an investment accounted for under the equity method based on the present \nvalue of the Group’s share of expected future cash flows of the investee, and analyses the \n~42~\nreasonableness of related assumptions. \nAs of June 30, 2025, the Group’s goodwill included in the investments accounted for under \nthe equity method, net of impairment loss, which was converted based on the closing \nexchange rate at the end of period, amounted to $8,800,277.\nC. Evaluation of inventories\nAs inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, the Group must \ndetermine the net realisable value of inventories on balance sheet date based on judgments \nand estimates. Due to the rapid technology innovation, the Group evaluates the amounts of \nnormal inventory consumption, obsolete inventories or inventories without market selling \nvalue on balance sheet date, and writes down the cost of inventories to the net realisable \nvalue. Such an evaluation of inventories is principally based on the demand for the \nproducts within the specified period in the future. Therefore, there might be significant \nchanges to the evaluation.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the carrying amount of inventories was $935,826,587.\n6.

The Group’s exposure to Pillar Two income taxes arising from the Pillar Two \nlegislation is as follows:\nThe Group is within the scope of the Pillar Two model rules published by the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Pillar Two \nlegislation was enacted in the European Union, Vietnam and Japan, the jurisdictions \nin which certain subsidiaries are incorporated, which became effective from the \nfiscal year of 2024. Additionally, the legislation was also substantively enacted in \nSingapore and Hong Kong, which became effective from the fiscal year of 2025.\nUnder the legislation, the Group has obligations to pay a top-up tax for the difference \nbetween its GloBE effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate. The \nGroup is in the process of assessing its exposure to the Pillar Two legislation for \nwhen it comes into effect. This assessment is for the jurisdictions of the European \nUnion, Vietnam, Japan and Singapore. However, due to the complexities in applying \nthe legislation, for subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where the Pillar Two \nlegislation has become effective or was substantially enacted, the impact of specific \n~94~\nadjustments in the Pillar Two legislation may result in different effective tax rates \ncompared to those calculated in accordance with IAS 12,‘Income taxes’.

OTHERS\n(1) Capital management\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to operate \nwith the goal to provide returns for shareholders and maintain an optimal capital structure to \nreduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may \nadjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce \ndebt. The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as \nnet debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘current \nand non-current borrowings’ as shown in the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash \nequivalents. Total capital is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the consolidated balance sheet \nless the total intangible assets.\nDuring 2025, the Group’s strategy, which was unchanged from 2024, was to maintain the \ngearing ratio at 70% or below.\n~108~\n(2) Financial instruments\nA.Financial instruments by category\nRefer to the consolidated balance sheets and Note 6 for the amounts and details of the \nfinancial assets (financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair \nvalue through other comprehensive income, financial assets at amortised cost, derivative \nfinancial assets for hedging, accounts receivable (including related parties) and other \nreceivables (including related parties)) and financial liabilities (financial liabilities at fair \nvalue through profit or loss,  accounts payable (including related parties), other payables, \nshort-term loans, short-term notes and bills payable, long-term liabilities, current portion, \nlong-term loans and corporate bonds payable).\nB.Financial risk management policies \n(a) Risk categories:\nThe Group employs a comprehensive risk management and control system to clearly \nidentify, measure, and control the various kinds of financial risk it faces, including \nmarket risk (including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit \nrisk, and liquidity risk.\n(b) Management objectives:\ni. Except for market risk, which is controlled by outside factors, the remainder of the \nforegoing types of risks can be controlled internally or removed from business \nprocesses. Therefore, the goal in managing each of these risks is to reduce them to \nzero.\nii. As for market risk, the goal is to optimize its overall position through strict \nanalysis, suggestion, execution and audit processes, and proper consideration of a) \nlong-term trends in the external economic/financial environment, b) internal \noperating conditions, and c) the actual effects of market fluctuations.\niii.

Except for market risk, which is controlled by outside factors, the remainder of the \nforegoing types of risks can be controlled internally or removed from business \nprocesses. Therefore, the goal in managing each of these risks is to reduce them to \nzero.\nii. As for market risk, the goal is to optimize its overall position through strict \nanalysis, suggestion, execution and audit processes, and proper consideration of a) \nlong-term trends in the external economic/financial environment, b) internal \noperating conditions, and c) the actual effects of market fluctuations.\niii. The Group's overall risk management policy focuses on the unpredictable item of \nfinancial markets and seeks to reduce the risk that potentially pose adverse effects \non the Group's financial position and financial performance.\niv. For the information on the derivative financial instruments that the Group enters \ninto, refer to Notes 6(2) and (6).\n(c) Management system:\ni. Risk management is executed by the Corporate Finance by following policies \napproved by the Board. Through cooperation with the Group's operating units, \nfinance department is responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial \nrisks.\nii. The Board has a written policy covering overall risk management. It also has \nwritten policies covering specific issues, such as exchange rate risk, interest rate \nrisk, credit risk, derivative and non-derivative financial instruments used, and the \ninvestment of excess working capital.\n~109~\nC.Significant financial risks and degrees of financial risks \n(a) Market risk\ni. Foreign exchange risk\n(i) Nature:\nThe Group is a multinational group in the Electronics manufacturing services \nindustry. Most of the exchange rate risk from operating activities come from:\na. Foreign exchange risk arises from different exchange rates to functional \ncurrency as the invoice dates of accounts receivable and payable denominated \nin non-functional foreign currency are different. Due to the characteristics of \nthe subcontracting industry, the Company’s revenue and expenditures are \nmostly denominated in foreign currency. Thus, the remaining net foreign \nexchange risk is not material after offsetting assets and liabilities. \nFurthermore, although the variations in currencies of the Company’s certain \nforeign investments in emerging countries (i.e. Vietnam and India, etc.) are \nconsidered huge, the percentage of the investments is not significant and thus \nthe Company’s foreign exchange risk can be maintained in the controllable \nrange. (Note: The Group has several sites in various countries and thus is \nexposed to various foreign exchange risks. The main risk arises from USD \nand RMB.)\nb. Except for the above transactions (operating activities) recognised in the \nincome statement, assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet and \nthe net investment in foreign operations also result in the exchange rate risk.\n(ii) Management:\na. For such risks, the Group has set up policies requiring companies in the \nGroup to manage its exchange rate risks.\nb. As to the exchange rate risk arising from the difference between various \nfunctional currencies and the reporting currency in the consolidated financial \nstatements, it is managed by the Corporate Finance.\n(iii) The source:\na. USD and TWD:\nForeign exchange risk arises primarily from USD-denominated cash, cash \nequivalents, accounts receivable and other receivables, loans, accounts \npayable and other payables, which results in exchange loss or gain when they \nare converted into TWD.\nb. USD and RMB:\nForeign exchange risk arises primarily from USD-denominated cash, cash \nequivalents, accounts receivable and other receivables, loans, accounts \n~110~\npayable and other payables, which results in exchange loss or gain when they \nare converted into RMB.\n(iv)Extent\nThe information on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies \nwhose values would be materially affected by the exchange rate fluctuations is \nas follows:\nFinancial assets\nMonetary items\nUSD : TWD $ 32,344,441 29.3 $ 947,692,129  5 % $ 47,384,606 \nUSD : RMB  43,626,713 7.1621  1,278,262,687  5 %  63,913,134 \nNet effect in \nconsolidated entities \nwith foreign currency\nUSD : TWD $ 66,013,607 29.3 $ 1,934,198,689 \nFinancial liabilities\nMonetary items\nUSD : TWD $ 37,766,559 29.3 $ 1,106,560,187  5 % $ 55,328,009 \nUSD : RMB  34,854,688 7.16  1,021,242,356  5 %  51,062,118 \nJune 30, 2025\nForeign \ncurrency \namount\n(in thousands)\nSensitivity analysis\n(Foreign currency: \nFunctional currency)\nExchange \nrate\nBook value\n(TWD)\nExtent of \nvariation\nEffect on profit \nor loss\nDecember 31, 2024\nForeign \ncurrency \namount\n(in thousands)\nSensitivity analysis\n(Foreign currency: \nFunctional currency)\nExchange \nrate\nBook value\n(TWD)\nExtent of \nvariation\nEffect on profit \nor loss\nFinancial assets\nMonetary items\nUSD : TWD $ 44,295,252 32.79 $ 1,452,441,312  5 % $ 72,622,066 \nUSD : RMB  53,691,274 7.3225  1,760,536,871  5 %  88,026,844 \nNet effect in \nconsolidated entities \nwith foreign currency\nUSD : TWD $ 59,263,084 32.79 $ 1,943,236,512 \nFinancial liabilities\nMonetary items\nUSD : TWD $ 48,635,623 32.79 $ 1,594,762,067  5 % $ 79,738,103 \nUSD : RMB  47,003,127 7.3225  1,541,232,547  5 %  77,061,627 \n~111~\nJune 30, 2024\nForeign \ncurrency \namount\n(in thousands)\nSensitivity analysis\n(Foreign currency: \nFunctional currency)\nExchange \nrate\nBook value\n(TWD)\nExtent of \nvariation\nEffect on profit \nor loss\nFinancial assets\nMonetary items\nUSD : TWD $ 30,445,698 32.45 $ 987,962,905  5 % $ 49,398,145 \nUSD : RMB  39,970,068 7.3003  1,297,028,710  5 %  64,851,436 \nNet effect in \nconsolidated entities \nwith foreign currency\nUSD : TWD $ 57,503,615 32.45 $ 1,865,992,304 \nFinanc"}

The information on comparative \nperiod was prepared and presented by the same logic. \n(v) Total exchange gain (loss) , including realised and unrealised arising from  \nsignificant foreign exchange variation on the monetary items held by the Group  \nfor the three months and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 amounted to \n$13,070,922, ($2,255,503), $9,787,439 and ($2,961,035), respectively.\nii. Equity securities\n(i) Nature\nThe Group primarily invests in domestic and foreign publicly traded equity \ninstruments, which are accounted for as financial assets at fair value through \nprofit or loss and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \nincome. The price of those equity instruments will be affected by the uncertainty \nof the future value of the investment.\n(ii) Extent\nIf such equity instruments’ price rise or fall by 1%, with all other factors held \nconstant, the impact on equity due to investments in equity instruments \nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and investments in \nequity at fair value through profit or loss are $979,129 and $947,323 for the six \nmonths ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\niii. Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk\n(i) The Group's interest rate risk arises from long-term loans and short-term loans. \nBorrowings with floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, \nbut part of the risks are offset by cash and cash equivalents with variable interest \nrates. Borrowings with fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate \n~112~\nrisk. The Group's borrowings consist of fixed and floating interest rates. During \nthe six months  ended June 30, 2025  and 2024, the Group’s borrowings at \nvariable rate were mainly denominated in USD, EUR and CZK.\n(ii) The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using fixed-to-fixed \ninterest rate swaps. Under these swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to \nexchange, at specified intervals (mainly quarterly), the difference between fixed \ncontract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the \nagreed notional principal amounts.\n(iii)If the borrowing interest rate had increased/decreased by 0.25% with all other \nvariables held constant, profit before income tax for the six months ended June \n30, 2025 and 2024 would have decreased/increased by $689,294 and $753,355, \nrespectively. The main factor is that changes in interest expense result from \nfloating-rate borrowings.\n(b) Credit risk\ni. Credit risk refers to the risk of financial loss to the Group arising from default by \nthe clients or counterparties of financial instruments. \nAccording to the Group’s credit policy, each local entity in the Group is responsible \nfor managing and analysing the credit risk for each of their new clients before \nstandard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group \nassesses the credit quality of the customers by taking into account their financial \nposition, past experience and other factors to conduct its internal risk management. \nIndividual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with \nlimits set by the board of directors. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly \nmonitored. Major credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative \nfinancial instruments and other financial instruments. The counterparties are banks \nwith good credit quality and financial institutions with investment grade or above \nand government agencies, so there is no significant compliance concerns and credit \nrisk.\nii. The Group assumes that if the contract payments were  past due over 90 days based \non the terms, there has been a significant increase in credit risk on that instrument \nsince initial recognition; if past due over 360 days, a default has occurred.\niii. The following indicators are used to determine whether the credit impairment of \ndebt instruments has occurred:\n(i) It becomes probable that the issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial \nreorganization due to their financial difficulties;\n(ii) Default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments;\n(iii)Adverse changes in national or regional economic conditions that are expected \nto cause a default.\n~113~\niv.

The different levels that the inputs to valuation techniques are used to measure fair value \nof financial and non-financial instruments have been defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that \nthe entity can access at the measurement date. A market is regarded as active \nwhere a market in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with \nsufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing \nbasis. The fair value of the Group’s investment in listed stocks and open-end \nfunds is included in Level 1.\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for \nthe asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair value of the Group’s \ninvestment in listed stocks during the lock-up period and most of the derivative \ninstruments is included in Level 2.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The fair value of the Group’s \nequity investment, bond investment, beneficiary certificates and contingent \nconsideration without active market is included in Level 3.\nB.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\n(1) General information\nThe Group has adopted eCMMS (E-enabled Components, Modules, Moves & Services) \nstrategy, and provided a one-stop shop to its customers, which are primarily in the 3C \nindustries, with a total solution for design, development, engineering, procurement, \nmanufacturing, logistics and after-sales service.\nThe Group segregates group systems from both a customer service and product perspective. \nEach segment’s performance is assessed based on the operating results of different group \nsystems in the consolidated financial statements reported for review by the chief operating \ndecision maker. \n(2) Measurement of segment information\nThe chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources of the \noperating segments based on each operating segment’s revenue and operating income after \nadjusting the internal costs and allocated expenses. Except for the recognition of internal costs \nwhich shall be in accordance with the Group’s related internal calculation basis, the operating \nsegments’ accounting policies are the same as disclosed in Note 4.\nIn accordance with IFRS No. 8, “Operating Segments”, the Group has determined the \noperating segments and reportable operating segments. Operating segments which have met \ncertain quantitative threshold are disclosed individually or aggregately as reportable operating \nsegments depending on whether the segments have similar economic characteristics and the \naggregation meets the core principal of the standard; other segments which have not met the \nquantitative threshold are included in ‘all other segments’. When deciding on an aggregate \ndisclosure, the criteria for consideration include: (1) the nature of the products and services; \n(2) the nature of the production process; (3) the customer types or categories of the products or \nservices; and (4) the methods used to distribute its products or provide its services. The Group \nhas identified the Hon Hai parent group, FII subgroup and FIH subgroup as reportable \nsegments.\n~130~\n(3) Segment information\nA.The segment information reported to the chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions for each segment is measured in a \nmanner consistent with that in the statement of comprehensive income. Thus, the reconciliation is not required.\nB.The segment information provided to the chief operating decision maker for the reportable segments is as follows:\nThree months ended June 30, 2025 \n(in millions) Hon Hai parent group FII subgroup FIH subgroup Others Elimination Consolidation\nExternal revenue $ 937,704 $ 855,073 $ 23,302 $ 36,384 $ (58,995) $ 1,793,468 \nInternal revenue  30,566  3,255  8,918  3,246  (45,985)  - \nOperating revenue $ 968,270 $ 858,328 $ 32,220 $ 39,630 $ (104,980) $ 1,793,468 \nDepreciation and amortisation $ 12,586 $ 7,842 $ 944 $ 2,843 $ (860) $ 23,355 \nSegment operating income $ 20,084 $ 34,226 $ 340 $ 1,067 $ 879 $ 56,596 \nThree months ended June 30, 2024 \n(in millions) Hon Hai parent group FII subgroup FIH subgroup Others Elimination Consolidation\nExternal revenue $ 928,368 $ 647,485 $ 20,237 $ 34,279 $ (79,818) $ 1,550,551 \nInternal revenue  20,843  3,453  8,838  2,840  (35,974)  - \nOperating revenue $ 949,211 $ 650,938 $ 29,075 $ 37,119 $ (115,792) $ 1,550,551 \nDepreciation and amortisation $ 8,665 $ 7,738 $ 1,039 $ 2,979 $ (1,151) $ 19,270 \nSegment operating income (loss) $ 22,418 $ 20,373 $ (640) $ 1,288 $ 1,165 $ 44,604 \nSix months ended June 30"}
