Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these \nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of \nFinancial Reports by Securities Issuers and International Accounting Standard 34, \"Interim Financial \nReporting\" that came into effect as endorsed by the Financial Supervisory Commission. Our \nresponsibility is to express a conclusion on these consolidated financial statements based on our reviews.\n     \nScope of review\nExcept as explained in the following paragraph, we conducted our reviews in accordance with the \nStandard on Review Engagements 2410, \"Review of Financial Information Performed by the Independent \nAuditor of the Entity\" of the Republic of China. A review of consolidated financial statements consists of \nmaking inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying \nanalytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit and \nconsequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant \nmatters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\n     \nBasis for qualified conclusion \nAs explained in Notes 4(3) and 6(10), the financial statements of certain insignificant consolidated \nsubsidiaries and investments accounted for using equity method were not reviewed by independent \nauditors. Those statements reflect total assets (including investments accounted for using equity method) \nof NT$303,911,239 thousand and NT$376,748,117 thousand, constituting 7.34% and 9.50% of the \nconsolidated total assets, and total liabilities of NT$64,405,313 thousand and NT$46,694,070 thousand, \nconstituting 2.57% and 2.08% of the consolidated total liabilities as at June 30, 2025 and 2024 \nrespectively, and the total comprehensive income (loss) (including share of profit (loss) and other \ncomprehensive income of associates and joint ventures accounted for using equity method) of \n(NT$7,227,763) thousand, NT$1,164,482 thousand, NT$3,697,874 thousand and (NT$9,377,797) \nthousand, constituting 3.65%, 2.23%, 3.22% and 7.22% of the consolidated total comprehensive income \nfor the three months and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These amounts and the \ninformation disclosed in Note 13 were based solely on the unreviewed financial statements of these \ncompanies as at June 30, 2025 and 2024.\nQualified conclusion \nBased on our reviews and the review reports of other auditors as described in Other matter  \nsection, except for the adjustments to the consolidated financial statements, if any, as might have been \n~2~"}

Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, ‘Amendments to the classification and measurement \nof financial instruments’ \nThe IASB issued the amendments to: \n(a) Clarify the date of recognition and derecognition of some financial assets and \nliabilities, with a new exception relating to the derecognition of a financial liability (or \npart of a financial liability) settled through an electronic cash transfer system. \nApplying the exception, an entity is permitted to derecognise a financial liability at an \nearlier date if, and only if, the entity has initiated a payment instruction and specific \nconditions are met. The conditions for the exception are that the entity making the \npayment does not have: \ni. the practical ability to withdraw, stop or cancel the payment instruction;\nii. the practical ability to access the cash used for settlement; and\niii.significant settlement risk.\n(b) Clarify and add further guidance for assessing whether a financial asset meets the \nsolely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criterion, covering contractual terms \nthat can change cash flows based on contingent events (for example, interest rates \nlinked to such as some instruments with features linked to the achievement of \nenvironment, social and governance (ESG) targets), non-recourse features and \ncontractually-linked instruments. \n(c) Add new disclosures for certain instruments with contractual terms that can change \ncash flows (such as some instruments with features linked to the achievement of ESG \ntargets), including a qualitative description of the nature of the contingent event, \nquantitative information about the possible changes to contractual cash flows that \ncould result from those contractual terms and the gross carrying amount of financial \nassets and amortised cost of financial liabilities subject to these contractual terms. \n(d) Update the disclosures for equity instruments designated at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income (FVOCI). The entity shall disclose the fair value of each class \nof investment and is no longer required to disclose the fair value of each investment. \nIn addition, the amendments require the entity to disclose the fair value gain or loss \npresented in other comprehensive income during the period, showing separately the \nfair value gain or loss related to investments derecognised during the reporting period \nand the fair value gain or loss related to investments held at the end of the reporting \nperiod and any transfers of the cumulative gain or loss within equity during the \nreporting period related to the investments derecognised during that reporting period.\n~12~"}

Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, ‘Contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity’\nThe amendments apply to contracts that expose an entity to variability in the underlying \namount of electricity because the source of electricity generation depends on \nuncontrollable natural conditions (such as the weather). These amendments include:\n(a) Clarifying the application of the ‘own use’ requirements for contracts to buy or sell \nnature dependent electricity:\nWhen the contract requires an entity to buy and take delivery of electricity when it is \ngenerated, and the design and operation of the market in which the electricity is \ntransacted under the contract require the entity to sell any amounts of unused \nelectricity within a specified time, the entity shall consider reasonable and supportable \ninformation regarding its past, current and expected future electricity transactions \nwithin a reasonable amount of time not exceeding 12 months. An entity is considered \na ‘net purchaser’ if it buys sufficient electricity to offset any sales of unused electricity \nin the same market in which the entity sold the electricity.\nAn entity applying these amendments to own use contracts referencing nature-\ndependent electricity shall disclose the following:\ni. Variability in the underlying amount of basic electricity and the risk that the entity \nwould be required to buy electricity during a delivery interval in which it cannot \nuse the electricity;\nii. Unrecognised contract commitments, including the expected future cash flows from \nbuying electricity under these contracts; and\niii.The effects of the contracts on the entity’s financial performance for the reporting \nperiod.\n(b) Permitting hedge accounting if these contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity \nare used as hedging instruments:\nAn entity is permitted to designate as the hedged item a variable nominal amount of \nforecast electricity transactions that is aligned with the variable amount of nature-\ndependent electricity expected to be delivered by the generation facility as referenced \nin the hedging instrument. Additionally, if the cash flows of the contract referencing \nnature-dependent electricity designated as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge \nrelationship are conditional on the occurrence of a forecast transaction, the forecast \ntransaction is presumed to be highly probable.\nFor entities that designate contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity as \nhedging instruments, the terms and conditions of such hedging instruments shall be \ndisclosed according to risk categories in compliance with IFRS 7.\n~13~"}

The areas involving a higher degree of \njudgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the \nconsolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 5.\n(3) Basis of consolidation\nA. Basis for preparation of consolidated financial statements:\n(a)All subsidiaries are included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. \nSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) controlled by the Group. The \nGroup controls an entity when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns \nfrom its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its \npower over the entity. Consolidation of subsidiaries begins from the date the Group \nobtains control of the subsidiaries and ceases when the Group loses control of the \nsubsidiaries.\n(b)Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions \nbetween companies within the Group are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries \nhave been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by \nthe Group.\n(c)Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the \nowners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income is \nattributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this \nresults in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n(d)Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the parent \nlosing control of the subsidiary (transactions with non-controlling interests) are \naccounted for as equity transactions, i.e. transactions with owners in their capacity as \nowners. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are \nadjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in \nequity.\n(e)When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the Group remeasures any investment \nretained in the former subsidiary at its fair value. That fair value is regarded as the fair \nvalue on initial recognition of a financial asset or the cost on initial recognition of the \nassociate or joint venture. Any difference between fair value and carrying amount is \nrecognised in profit or loss. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive \nincome in relation to the subsidiary should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss or \ntransferred to retained earnings as specified by applicable IFRSs.\n~15~"}

On the other \nhand, for accounts receivable or contract assets that do not contain a significant financing \ncomponent, the Group recognises the impairment provision for lifetime ECLs.\n(12) Derecognition of financial assets\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when one of the following conditions is met:\nA. The contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the financial asset expire.\nB. The contractual rights to receive cash flows of the financial asset have been transferred and \nthe Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial \nasset.\nC. The contractual rights to receive cash flows of the financial asset have been transferred; \nand the Group has not retained control of the financial asset.\n(13) Leasing arrangement (lessor) – Lease receivables / Operating leases\nA.

The difference between gross lease receivable and the \npresent value of the receivable is recognised as ‘unearned finance income of finance \nlease’.\n(b) The lessor should allocate finance income over the lease term based on a systematic and \nrational basis reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment \nin the finance lease.\n(c) Lease payments (excluding costs for services) during the lease term are applied against \nthe gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and the unearned finance \nincome.\nB. Lease income from an operating lease (net of any incentives given to the lessee) is \nrecognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n(14) Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the \nweighted-average method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw \nmaterials, direct labor, other direct costs and related production overheads (allocated based on \nnormal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. The item by item approach is used in \napplying the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling \nprice in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the \nestimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n(15) Non-current assets held for sale \nNon-current assets are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be \nrecovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and a sale \nis considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value \nless costs to sell. \n(16) Investments accounted for under the equity method / associates\nA. Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. In \ngeneral, it is presumed that the investor has significant influence, if an investor holds, \ndirectly or indirectly 20 percent or more of the voting power of the investee. Investments in \nassociates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.\nB. The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit \nor loss, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is \nrecognised in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in an \nassociate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured \nreceivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or \nconstructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\nC.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the \nextent of the Group’s interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless \nthe transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting \npolicies of associates have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the \npolicies adopted by the Group.\nE. In the case that an associate issues new shares and the Group does not subscribe or acquire \nnew shares proportionately, which results in a change in the Group’s ownership percentage \nof the associate but maintains significant influence on the associate, then ‘capital surplus’ \nand ‘investments accounted for under the equity method’ shall be adjusted for the increase \nor decrease of its share of equity interest. If the above condition causes a decrease in the \nGroup’s ownership percentage of the associate, in addition to the above adjustment, the \namounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate \nare reclassified to profit or loss proportionately on the same basis as would be required if \nthe relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of or transferred. The amounts previously \nrecognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate are directly \ntransferred to retained earnings proportionately on the same basis if the relevant assets or \nliabilities were disposed of and transferred to retained earnings directly according to the \nrequirements in IFRSs.\nF. Upon loss of significant influence over an associate, the Group remeasures any investment \nretained in the former associate at its fair value. Any difference between fair value and \ncarrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.\nG. When the Group disposes its investment in an associate and loses significant influence over \nthis associate, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in \nrelation to the associate, are reclassified to profit or loss, on the same basis as would be \nrequired if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of or the amounts previously \nrecognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate are directly \ntransferred to retained earnings on the same basis if the relevant assets or liabilities were \ndisposed of and transferred to retained earnings directly according to the requirements in \nIFRSs.

Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Borrowing costs incurred \nduring the construction period are capitalised.\nB. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate \nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with \nthe item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

An impairment loss is recognised for the \namount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The \nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell or value in use. \nExcept for goodwill, when the circumstances or reasons for recognising impairment loss for \nan asset in prior periods no longer exist or diminish, the impairment loss is reversed. The \nincreased carrying amount due to reversal should not be more than what the depreciated or \namortised historical cost would have been if the impairment had not been recognised.\nB.

Borrowings \nare subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of \ntransaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the period of \nthe borrowings using the effective interest method.\n(24) Notes and accounts payable\nA. Accounts payable are liabilities for purchases of raw materials, goods or services and notes \npayable are those resulting from operating and non-operating activities.\nB.

At the inception of the hedging relationship, there is formal designation and documentation \nof the hedging relationship and the Group’s risk management objective and strategy for \nundertaking the hedge. That documentation shall include identification of the hedging \ninstrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will \nassess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.\nB. The Group designates the hedging relationship as follows:\nCash flow hedge: a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to \na particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast \ntransaction.\nC. Cash flow hedges\na. The cash flow hedge reserve associated with the hedged item is adjusted to the lower of \nthe following (in absolute amounts):\ni. the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge; \nand \nii.the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge.\nb. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other \ncomprehensive income. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the \nineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.\nc. The amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance \nwith (a) is accounted for as follows:\ni.If a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-\nfinancial asset or non-financial liability, or a hedged forecast transaction for a non-\nfinancial asset or non-financial liability becomes a firm commitment for which fair \nvalue hedge accounting is applied, the Group shall remove that amount from the cash \nflow hedge reserve and include it directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount \nof the asset or liability.\nii.For cash flow hedges other than those covered by i. above, that amount shall be \nreclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification \nadjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future \ncash flows affect profit or loss.\niii.If that amount is a loss and the Group expects that all or a portion of that loss will not \nbe recovered in one or more future periods, it shall immediately reclassify the amount \n~36~"}

Provisions \nare measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the \nobligation on the balance sheet date, which is discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that \nreflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the \nobligation. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to passage of time is \nrecognised as interest expense. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\n(33) Employee benefits\nA. Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits \nexpected to be paid in respect of service rendered by employees in a period and should be \nrecognised as expense in that period when the employees render service.\nB. Pensions\n(a) Defined contribution plans\nFor defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognised as pension expense \nwhen they are due on an accrual basis. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset \nto the extent of a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments.\n(b) Defined benefit plans\ni. Net obligation under a defined benefit plan is defined as the present value of an \namount of pension benefits that employees will receive on retirement for their \nservices with the Group in current period or prior periods. The liability recognised \nin the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value \nof the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan \nassets. The net defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent \nactuaries using the projected unit credit method. The rate used to discount is \ndetermined by using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are \ndenominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms \nto maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability; when there \n~37~"}

Remeasurements arising on defined benefit plans are recognised in other \ncomprehensive income in the period in which they arise and are recorded as \nretained earnings.\niii. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\niv. Pension cost for the interim period is calculated on a year-to-date basis by using the \npension cost rate derived from the actuarial valuation at the end of the prior \nfinancial year, adjusted for significant market fluctuations since that time and for \nsignificant curtailments, settlements, or other significant one-off events. Also, the \nrelated information is disclosed accordingly.\nC. Employees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration\nEmployees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration are recognised as expense and \nliability, provided that such recognition is required under legal or constructive obligation \nand those amounts can be reliably estimated. Any difference between the resolved amounts \nand the subsequently actual distributed amounts is accounted for as changes in estimates. If \nemployee compensation is paid by shares, the Group calculates the number of shares based \non the closing price at the previous day of the board meeting resolution.\n(34) Employee share-based payment\nA. For the equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, the employee services received \nare measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the grant date, and are \nrecognised as compensation cost over the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment \nto equity. The fair value of the equity instruments granted shall reflect the impact of market \nvesting conditions and non-vesting conditions. Compensation cost is subject to adjustment \nbased on the service conditions that are expected to be satisfied and the estimates of the \nnumber of equity instruments that are expected to vest under the non-market vesting \nconditions at each balance sheet date. Ultimately, the amount of compensation cost \nrecognised is based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.\nB. Restricted stocks:\na. Restricted stocks issued to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity \ninstruments granted at the grant date, and are recognised as compensation cost over the \nvesting period.\nb. For restricted stocks where those stocks do not restrict distribution of dividends to \nemployees and employees are not required to return the dividends received if they resign \nduring the vesting period, the Group recognises the fair value of the dividends received \nby the employees who are expected to resign during the vesting period as compensation \ncost at the date of dividends declared.\nc. For restricted stocks where employees have to pay to acquire those stocks, if employees \nresign during the vesting period, they must return the stocks to the Group and the Group \nmust refund their payments on the stocks. For restricted stocks issued with consideration \nwith the grant date set on or after October 11, 2024, the Group recognises the payments \nfrom the employees who had paid to acquire the stocks as liabilities at the grant date; For \n~38~"}

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in \nprofit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive \nincome or items recognised directly in equity, in which cases the tax is recognised in other \ncomprehensive income or equity.\nB. The current income tax expense is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or \nsubstantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its \nsubsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates \npositions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in accordance with applicable tax \nregulations. It establishes provisions where appropriate based on the amounts expected to \nbe paid to the tax authorities. An additional tax is levied on the unappropriated retained \nearnings and is recognised as income tax expense in the year the stockholders resolve to \nretain the earnings.\nC. Deferred income tax is recognised, using the balance sheets liability method, on temporary \ndifferences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts \nin the consolidated balance sheet. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if \nit arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other \nthan a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting \nnor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary \ndifferences. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on \ninvestments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the \ntemporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary \ndifference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax is determined \nusing tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date \nand are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the \ndeferred income tax liability is settled.\nD. Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future \ntaxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. At \neach balance sheet date, unrecognised and recognised deferred income tax assets are \nreassessed.\nE. Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the \nbalance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and \nthere is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability \nsimultaneously.

A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carryforward of unused tax credits resulting \nfrom acquisitions of equipment or technology, research and development expenditures and \nequity investments to the extent that it is possible that future taxable profit will be available \nagainst which the unused tax credits can be utilised.\nG. The interim period income tax expense is recognised based on the estimated average \nannual effective income tax rate expected for the full financial year applied to the pretax \nincome of the interim period, and the related information is disclosed accordingly.\n(36) Dividends\nDividends are recorded in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which they are \nresolved by the Company’s shareholders. Cash dividends are recorded as liabilities; stock \ndividends are recorded as stock dividends to be distributed and are reclassified to ordinary \nshares on the effective date of new shares issuance.\n(37) Revenue recognition\nA. The Group manufactures and sells consumer electronics products. Sales are recognised \nwhen control of the products have transferred, being when the products are delivered to or \npicked by the customers, the customers have full discretion over the channel and price to \nsell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s \nacceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the \nspecific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customers, \nand either the customers has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, or \nthe Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\nB. Sales revenue is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated \nsales discounts and allowances. Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly \nprobable that a significant reversal will not occur. The estimation is subject to an \nassessment at each reporting date. The contract cost does not include a significant financing \ncomponent as the sales are made with credit term consistent with market practice.\nC. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the \nconsideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the \npayment is due.\nD. The Group’s obligation to provide a refund for faulty products under the standard warranty \nterms is recognised as a provision.\nE. The customer pays at the time specified in the payment schedule. If the products sold \nexceed the payment, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the products \nsold, a contract liability is recognised.\n(38) Government grants\nGovernment grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in \nwhich the Group recognises expenses for the related costs for which the grants are intended to \ncompensate.

The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The \nconsideration transferred for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets \ntransferred, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued at the acquisition \ndate, plus the fair value of any assets and liabilities resulting from a contingent \nconsideration arrangement. All acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. \nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business \ncombination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. For each \nbusiness combination, the Group measures at the acquisition date components of non-\ncontrolling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their \nholders to the proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation at \neither fair value or the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognised \namounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. All other non-controlling interests should \nbe measured at the acquisition-date fair value.\nB. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in \nthe acquiree and the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair \nvalue of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill \nat the acquisition date. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest in \nthe acquiree recognised and the fair value of previously held equity interest in the acquiree \nis less than the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, the \ndifference is recognised directly in profit or loss on the acquisition date.\n(40) Operating segments\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to \nthe chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing \nperformance of the operating segments.\n5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON \nUNCERTAINTY\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical \njudgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies and make critical assumptions and \nestimates concerning future events. Assumptions and estimates may differ from the actual results \nand are continually evaluated and adjusted based on historical experience and other factors. The \nabove information is addressed below:\n(1) Critical judgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies \nA. Revenue recognition\nThe Group determines whether the nature of its performance obligation is to provide the \nspecified goods or services itself (i.e. the Group is a principal) or to arrange for the other \nparty to provide those goods or services (i.e. the Group is an agent) based on the \ntransaction model and its economic substance. The Group is a principal if it controls a \n~41~"}

The Group \nrecognises revenue at gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in \nexchange for those goods or services transferred. The Group is an agent if its performance \nobligation is to arrange for the provision of goods or services by another party. The Group \nrecognises revenue at the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be \nentitled in exchange for arranging for the other party to provide its goods or services.\nAfter receiving the materials or services procured, the Group directs the use of the goods \nand services and provides critical manufacturing processing technique, in order to produce \nand significantly integrate various goods and services into the combined output as the \nresulting devices and transfers to a customer. The following indicators are used to \ndetermine whether the Group controls the good or service before it is transferred to a \ncustomer and considers itself as a principal:\n(a)The Group is primarily responsible for the provision of goods or services;\n(b)The Group assumes the inventory risk before transferring the specified goods or \nservices to the customer or after transferring control of the goods or services to the \ncustomer.\n(c)The Group has discretion in establishing prices for the goods or services. \nB. Offsetting financial instruments\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported in the net amount in \nthe balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts \nand there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability \nsimultaneously.\n(2) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions based on the expectation of future events that are \nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances at the end of the reporting period. The \nresulting accounting estimates might be different from the actual results. The estimates and \nassumptions that may significantly adjust the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within \nthe next financial year are addressed below:\nA. Impairment assessment of goodwill\nThe Group assesses impairment of goodwill based on subjective judgment which includes \nidentifying and allocating assets, liabilities and goodwill to related cash-generating unit to \ndetermine recoverable amount of this unit. Details of impairment assessment of goodwill \nis provided in Note 6(14).\nAs of June 30, 2025 , the Group recognised goodwill after impairment assessment of  \n$19,540,106.\nB. Impairment assessment of investments accounted for using equity method \nThe Group assesses the impairment of an investment accounted for using equity method \nand the goodwill it contains as soon as there is any indication that it might have been \nimpaired and its carrying amount cannot be recovered. The Group assesses the recoverable \namounts of an investment accounted for under the equity method based on the present \nvalue of the Group’s share of expected future cash flows of the investee, and analyses the \n~42~"}

Evaluation of inventories\nAs inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, the Group must \ndetermine the net realisable value of inventories on balance sheet date based on judgments \nand estimates. Due to the rapid technology innovation, the Group evaluates the amounts of \nnormal inventory consumption, obsolete inventories or inventories without market selling \nvalue on balance sheet date, and writes down the cost of inventories to the net realisable \nvalue. Such an evaluation of inventories is principally based on the demand for the \nproducts within the specified period in the future. Therefore, there might be significant \nchanges to the evaluation.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the carrying amount of inventories was $935,826,587.\n6.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may \nadjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce \ndebt. The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as \nnet debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘current \nand non-current borrowings’ as shown in the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash \nequivalents. Total capital is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the consolidated balance sheet \nless the total intangible assets.\nDuring 2025, the Group’s strategy, which was unchanged from 2024, was to maintain the \ngearing ratio at 70% or below.\n~108~"}

Foreign exchange risk\n(i) Nature:\nThe Group is a multinational group in the Electronics manufacturing services \nindustry. Most of the exchange rate risk from operating activities come from:\na. Foreign exchange risk arises from different exchange rates to functional \ncurrency as the invoice dates of accounts receivable and payable denominated \nin non-functional foreign currency are different. Due to the characteristics of \nthe subcontracting industry, the Company’s revenue and expenditures are \nmostly denominated in foreign currency. Thus, the remaining net foreign \nexchange risk is not material after offsetting assets and liabilities. \nFurthermore, although the variations in currencies of the Company’s certain \nforeign investments in emerging countries (i.e. Vietnam and India, etc.) are \nconsidered huge, the percentage of the investments is not significant and thus \nthe Company’s foreign exchange risk can be maintained in the controllable \nrange. (Note: The Group has several sites in various countries and thus is \nexposed to various foreign exchange risks. The main risk arises from USD \nand RMB.)\nb. Except for the above transactions (operating activities) recognised in the \nincome statement, assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet and \nthe net investment in foreign operations also result in the exchange rate risk.\n(ii) Management:\na. For such risks, the Group has set up policies requiring companies in the \nGroup to manage its exchange rate risks.\nb. As to the exchange rate risk arising from the difference between various \nfunctional currencies and the reporting currency in the consolidated financial \nstatements, it is managed by the Corporate Finance.\n(iii) The source:\na.

Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk\n(i) The Group's interest rate risk arises from long-term loans and short-term loans. \nBorrowings with floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, \nbut part of the risks are offset by cash and cash equivalents with variable interest \nrates. Borrowings with fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate \n~112~"}
{"doc_id": "HonHai_q2_2025", "title": "HonHai_q2_2025.pdf", "page": 113, "text": "risk. The Group's borrowings consist of fixed and floating interest rates. During \nthe six months  ended June 30, 2025  and 2024, the Group’s borrowings at \nvariable rate were mainly denominated in USD, EUR and CZK.\n(ii) The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using fixed-to-fixed \ninterest rate swaps. Under these swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to \nexchange, at specified intervals (mainly quarterly), the difference between fixed \ncontract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the \nagreed notional principal amounts.\n(iii)If the borrowing interest rate had increased/decreased by 0.25% with all other \nvariables held constant, profit before income tax for the six months ended June \n30, 2025 and 2024 would have decreased/increased by $689,294 and $753,355, \nrespectively. The main factor is that changes in interest expense result from \nfloating-rate borrowings.\n(b) Credit risk\ni. Credit risk refers to the risk of financial loss to the Group arising from default by \nthe clients or counterparties of financial instruments. \nAccording to the Group’s credit policy, each local entity in the Group is responsible \nfor managing and analysing the credit risk for each of their new clients before \nstandard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group \nassesses the credit quality of the customers by taking into account their financial \nposition, past experience and other factors to conduct its internal risk management. \nIndividual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with \nlimits set by the board of directors. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly \nmonitored. Major credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative \nfinancial instruments and other financial instruments. The counterparties are banks \nwith good credit quality and financial institutions with investment grade or above \nand government agencies, so there is no significant compliance concerns and credit \nrisk.\nii. The Group assumes that if the contract payments were  past due over 90 days based \non the terms, there has been a significant increase in credit risk on that instrument \nsince initial recognition; if past due over 360 days, a default has occurred.\niii. The following indicators are used to determine whether the credit impairment of \ndebt instruments has occurred:\n(i) It becomes probable that the issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial \nreorganization due to their financial difficulties;\n(ii) Default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments;\n(iii)Adverse changes in national or regional economic conditions that are expected \nto cause a default.\n~113~"}

Except for financial instruments with active markets, the fair value of other \nfinancial instruments is measured by using valuation techniques or by reference to \ncounterparty quotes.

When assessing non-standard and low-complexity financial instruments,  for \nexample, cross currency swap contracts,  t he Group adopts valuation technique \nthat is widely used by market participants. The inputs used in the valuation \nmethod to measure these financial instruments are normally observable in the \nmarket.\niv. The valuation of derivative financial instruments is based on valuation model \nwidely accepted by market participants, such as present value techniques and \noption pricing models. Forward exchange contracts are usually valued based on \nthe current forward exchange rate (Black-Scholes model).\nv. The output of valuation model is an estimated value and the valuation technique \nmay not be able to capture all relevant factors of the Group’s financial and non-\nfinancial instruments. Therefore, the estimated value derived using valuation \nmodel is adjusted accordingly with additional inputs, for example, model risk or \nliquidity risk, etc. In accordance with the Group’s management policies and \nrelevant control procedures relating to the valuation models used for fair value \nmeasurement, management believes adjustment to valuation is necessary in order \nto reasonably represent the fair value of financial and non-financial instruments at \nthe consolidated balance sheet. The inputs and pricing information used during \nvaluation are carefully assessed and adjusted based on current market conditions.\n~122~"}

Except for the recognition of internal costs \nwhich shall be in accordance with the Group’s related internal calculation basis, the operating \nsegments’ accounting policies are the same as disclosed in Note 4.\nIn accordance with IFRS No. 8, “Operating Segments”, the Group has determined the \noperating segments and reportable operating segments. Operating segments which have met \ncertain quantitative threshold are disclosed individually or aggregately as reportable operating \nsegments depending on whether the segments have similar economic characteristics and the \naggregation meets the core principal of the standard; other segments which have not met the \nquantitative threshold are included in ‘all other segments’. When deciding on an aggregate \ndisclosure, the criteria for consideration include: (1) the nature of the products and services; \n(2) the nature of the production process; (3) the customer types or categories of the products or \nservices; and (4) the methods used to distribute its products or provide its services.

The remaining shared limit is included in FIH Mobile Limited's. The net asset value of the endorser/guarantor is used to calculate the limit.
