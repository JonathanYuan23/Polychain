Sharp is currently under -\ntaking major transformations for our future growth, and it is a great challenge for me to assume the \nheavy responsibility of President and CEO.   \nOpening Remarks\nI joined Sharp in 1980 and dedicated my whole career to the Company. My deep commitment to \nthe Company and strong desire to mold Sharp into a company admired worldwide are second to \nnone.\nI would like to begin by sharing three principles that I have learned from my mentors and have \ncome to deeply value and apply in my business management.     \nThe first is our Business Philosophy and Business Creed. Our Business Philosophy expresses \nthe ideal figure we should aim for, and our Business Creed explains the thoughts and beliefs we \nshould all hold to achieve this Philosophy. Only by cherishing these two elements can we embody \nthe true Sharp character that enables us to create unique values from a perspective different from \nthat of other companies.\nThe second is to make efforts every day and never give up. This expresses the spirit of founder \nHayakawa who overcame countless challenges. I encouraged myself with these words and over -\ncame many difficulties. Now is the time to embody this spirit. I intend to lead Sharp by example to \nface challenges with the spirit to never give up.\nThe last principle is our quality slogan: Quality First in Heart and Mind . We ran into a quality \nproblem during my time as a section manager that required painstaking efforts to regain trust.      \nThis experience reinforced my belief that prioritizing quality and earning customer trust is of ut-\nmost importance. To this day, I still hang a poster of this slogan in my office as a daily reminder.\nMy Mission\nOur current business environment is more challenging than anticipated. Although the brand business \nachieved steady profits amid such circumstances, performance in the Display Device business deterio-\nrated significantly. We recorded substantial losses in fiscal 2022 and 2023 and experienced a decline \nin our financial position as a result, falling short of stakeholders’ expectations for our company.\nSharp announced the Medium-Term Management Direction on May 14, 2024, focusing on re-\nforming the device business, establishing a new growth model, and reinforcing HQ functions.\nI will elaborate further on the specific details of this direction in the following section. I myself took \nresponsibility and played an active role in the formulation of this critical plan to revitalize Sharp.\nI recognize the path forward will not be an easy one, but as CEO, I am committed to executing \nthis Medium-Term Management Direction to meet the expectations of our stakeholders.\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n1"}

The reason behind our stagnant growth is that we fell into the negative \ncycle, hindering our ability to enhance cash generation.\nWhile large-scale investment is required for the device business to remain competitive, we have \nnot been able to make sufficient investments for a long time. As a result, our competitiveness \ndeclined in the device business and hindered our ability to develop new categories, attract new cus-\ntomers, and explore other growth areas.

In addition, the consumer spending has shifted from the nesting demand to travel and eating out, \nresulting in weak demand for consumer electronics and other products. The brand businesses, which import products manufactured at \noverseas factories, and sell them in Japan, were negatively affected by the weakening yen.\nConsolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 amounted to 2,321.9 billion yen, down 8.9% year on year. Sales in Smart Life & Energy, \nUniversal Network, Display Device, and Electronic Device decreased, despite an increase in Smart Office sales.\nOperating loss narrowed to 20.3 billion yen, compared to an operating loss of 25.7 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Smart Office \nand Universal Network reported a significant increase in profit. However, the operating loss in Display Device increased significantly due to \nan abrupt deterioration in demand for small- and medium-size displays, and besides, Smart Life & Energy and Electronic Device recorded a \ndecrease in profit. Ordinary loss was 7.0 billion yen, compared to an ordinary loss of 30.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Loss attribut-\nable to owners of the parent amounted to 149.9 billion yen, compared to a loss attributable to owners of the parent of 260.8 billion yen \nin the previous fiscal year. As non-operating income, we recorded foreign exchange gains of 13.3 billion yen and share of profit of entities \naccounted for using equity method of 8.3 billion yen. In addition, as extraordinary income, we recorded a gain on change in equity of 4.2 \nbillion yen and a gain on reversal of liabilities of 4.8 billion yen as a result of the decrease in the ownership interest in SDP Global (China) \nCo., Ltd., an equity-method affiliate of Sakai Display Products Corporation, while we recorded extraordinary losses including impairment \nlosses of 122.3 billion yen related to Display Device and business restructuring expenses of 11.7 billion yen.\nSharp decided there would be no dividend payment for fiscal 2023, as the Company posted a net loss for this period.  \nAnalysis of Changes in Net Sales\nFiscal 2023 Review\nSharp Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31\n0\n-50\n(billions of yen)\n100\n50\n2,400\n2,300\n0\nSmart Life\n& Energy Smart\nOfﬁce\nUniversal\nNetwork\nUniversal\nNetwork\n(billions of yen)\n2,600\n2,500\n2023 2024 2023 2024\n0\n-20\n-40\n(billions of yen)\n20\n2023 2024\nFY2022\nSDP\n-61.2 FY2023\nSDP\n-25.0\nCost reductions,\nmodel mix\n+59.4FY2022\n(excluding\nSDP)\n35.5\nFY2023\n(excluding\nSDP)\n4.7\nSales\n-64.7\nOverhead\nexpense\n+6.2\nForeign\nexchange\n-13.5\nElectronic\nDevice\nDisplay\nDevice\nSmart Life\n& Energy\nElectronic\nDevice\nDisplay\nDevice\nSmart\nOfﬁce\nLower\nselling\nprices\n-18.2\nAdjust-\nments\n2,548.1\n2,321.9\n-25.7 -20.3-25.7\n-20.3\nAdjust-\nments\nAnalysis of Changes in Operating Profit\n0\n-50\n(billions of yen)\n100\n50\n2,400\n2,300\n0\nSmart Life\n& Energy Smart\nOfﬁce\nUniversal\nNetwork\nUniversal\nNetwork\n(billions of yen)\n2,600\n2,500\n2023 2024 2023 2024\n0\n-20\n-40\n(billions of yen)\n20\n2023 2024\nFY2022\nSDP\n-61.2 FY2023\nSDP\n-25.0\nCost reductions,\nmodel mix\n+59.4FY2022\n(excluding\nSDP)\n35.5\nFY2023\n(excluding\nSDP)\n4.7\nSales\n-64.7\nOverhead\nexpense\n+6.2\nForeign\nexchange\n-13.5\nElectronic\nDevice\nDisplay\nDevice\nSmart Life\n& Energy\nElectronic\nDevice\nDisplay\nDevice\nSmart\nOfﬁce\nLower\nselling\nprices\n-18.2\nAdjust-\nments\n2,548.1\n2,321.9\n-25.7 -20.3-25.7\n-20.3\nAdjust-\nments\n■\t\tThe global economy remained challenging \ndue to geopolitical issues, deep-seated \ninflation, and other factors, despite recovery \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic\n■\t\tExtremely challenging business environment \ndue to an abrupt decline in demand for \nsmall- and medium-size displays\n■\t\tNet sales declined year on year due to a \nsignificant decrease in sales from Display \nDevice and other segments\n■\t\tOperating and ordinary losses persisted due \nto weak performance in Display Device; \nhowever, losses narrowed due to improved \nprofitability in the brand businesses\n■\t\tSignificant net loss during the period due \nto impairment losses in Display Device and \nother factors \n■\t\tNo dividend payment for fiscal 2023 due to \nnet loss\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n10"}

Under these circumstances, global movements aimed at resolving so-\ncial issues are accelerating, such as those designed to respond to Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs) and carbon neutrality\n*1\n, as well as initiatives to realize a circular economy\n*2\n.\nIn 2019, Sharp established its long-term environmental vision SHARP Eco Vision 2050  based on \nits principal environmental philosophy of “Creating an Environmentally Conscious Company with \nSincerity and Creativity“, which was established in 1992. Our aim is to realize a sustainable global \nenvironment by setting long-term goals for 2050 in the areas of climate change, resource recy-\ncling, and safety and security.\nToward achieving the SHARP Eco Vision 2050, we have defined long term goals in the three following areas to generate clean energy in excess of energy consumed and minimize the environmental impact of corporate \nactivities on the global environment.\nThroughout our history, Sharp has endeavored to reduce the energy \nwe use as an organization, while making more energy-efficiency \nproducts to help reduce the amount of energy consumed in the \nhome and by society.\nAs our founder, Tokuji Hayakawa, said, “Everything we produce \nuses electricity. As we become a bigger company, we will be respon-\nsible for using more electricity, so I propose that we also begin \nmaking electricity.” Following this course, Sharp began development \nof solar cell, striving to popularize photovoltaic power generation for \nmore than 50 years.\nSharp factories use a variety of chemical \nsubstances in the product manufactur-\ning process. Our products also contain a \nvariety of chemical substances. Chemical \nsubstances include substances that \nhave a negative impact on the human \nbody, the environment, and ecosystems. \nAccordingly, these chemicals must be \nmanaged in a careful and detailed manner.\nSharp has created new products that offer \na variety of value to the world. At the same \ntime, we have used many of the world’s \nresources.\nSharp supports the global goal of achieving carbon neutrality, and we have set ourselves \nthe challenge of meeting the following two goals by 2050 in our own activities and \nthroughout the supply chain as a whole, so that we can achieve a decarbonized society. \nSharp follows current international standards, as well as our own \nstandards oriented toward the future, for the strict management \nof these relevant chemical substances. Under these standards, we \nare striving to eliminate any negative effects that chemicals may \nhave on human health, the global environment, or ecosystems.\nSharp intends to reach new levels of effective resource use, \nmaximizing value from minimal resources and constructing a \ncircular economy. We have defined two goals to achieve by the \nyear 2050 in efforts to create a recycling-oriented society.\n•  Conduct proper management of chemical substances \nto protect human health, the global environment, \nand ecosystems\n• Eliminate the use of new mined resources* in products\n•  Eliminate final disposal of waste products generated \nthrough our business activities\nAs a company that makes products that use electricity, we must take\nresponsibility for the environmental impact of this electricity usage.\nLong-Term Environmental Targets\nFurthermore, in order to realize our long-term environmental vision, we are formulating “me-\ndium-term environmental goals” that set specific initiatives and quantitative goals for each area. \nWith regard to climate change, a pressing issue worldwide, we accelerate our efforts to achieve \nnet-zero CO2 emissions arising from our own business activities by 2030.\nSharp is engaged in initiatives to solve social issues and sustainably raise corporate value. In \norder to accomplish the initiatives, we will work more closely with our stakeholders through corpo -\nrate and environmental conservation activities.\n*1 A state in which the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions minus the absorption volume is effectively zero. \n*2  An economic system in which discarded products and raw materials are considered as new resources and in which resources \nare circulated without generating waste products.\n• Achieve net zero CO 2 emissions due to our own business activities\n•  Generate clean energy in excess of the energy consumed throughout our \nsupply chain\nOur desire is to continue to offer a variety of value to our \nstakeholders amid the constraints of limited resources.\nSharp corporate activities must not do harm to human \nhealth, the global environment, or ecosystems.\nClimate \nChange\nResource \nRecycling\nGoals Goals Goals\nSee the following for more information on Sharp’s environmental activities.\nhttps://global.sharp/corporate/eco/environment/\nThe SHARP Eco Vision 2050, Our Long-Term Environmental Vision\nSafety and \nSecurity"}

Based on this policy, we \nhave formulated and published the SHARP Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook in accord -\nance with the RBA Code of Conduct, and, in our basic agreements for ongoing transactions, have \nestablished mandatory compliance with Guidebook-based CSR initiatives for our suppliers.\nIn order to identify, assess, and appropriately address CSR risks such as forced labor in the supply \nchain, we conduct CSR/green procurement surveys for each of our suppliers’ plants on a regular basis \nin accordance with the RBA Self-Assessment \nQuestionnaire. We also provide feedback on as-\nsessment results and require suppliers with plants \nthat scored low in any area to submit improve -\nment plans. In this way, we work to enhance \nsustainable CSR initiatives. In fiscal 2023, we con-\nducted CSR/green procurement surveys at 393 \nbases of 99 companies that we procure from.\nWe will continue to strengthen our CSR ef-\nforts throughout the supply chain, aiming to \nbuild a globally responsible supply chain.\nIn recent years, in addition to legal frameworks such as the U.S.’s Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act and the EU’s Conflict Minerals Convention, the scope of responsible \nmineral procurement has been expanding in terms of minerals, regions, and risks. Society demands \nthat companies practice responsible mineral procurement from CSR perspectives against the back-\ndrop of child labor and environmental destruction at mineral mining sites. Sharp’s basic policy is \nto take appropriate measures to ensure that we are neither complicit in human rights abuses or \nenvironmental destruction nor interfering with sound and legitimate local business activities in our \nsupply chain for procuring minerals mined in conflict-affected and high-risk areas.\nUnder this basic policy, we established an investigation system at each of our major business units \nand manufacturing subsidiaries. Through our membership in industry associations such as the Respon-\nsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association \n(JEITA), we monitor the latest global trends and pursue relevant measures based on the OECD Due Dili-\ngence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.\nFurthermore, the Sustainability Committee*, chaired by the Representative President and CEO, \ndesignates responsible mineral procurement as a key theme for initiatives and monitors the progress \nof related measures.\n*Please refer to P .12.\nTo gain customer trust and improve sat-\nisfaction, Sharp responds to customer \nneeds and demands by offering products \nand services that are safe, high-quality, \nand reliable.\nQuality Assurance System\nSharp specifies the quality levels we \npromise to customers, thereby ensur -\ning all employees in every department \ninvolved in product planning, design, \nproduction, sales, and after-sales service \ncontinue to strive for improved quality.\nIn recent years, expectations and demands related to supply chain due diligence initiatives have \nbeen increasing in light of the emergence of human rights and environmental risks in the global \nsupply chain, as well as the strengthening of related laws, regulations, and import/export restric-\ntions in various countries.\nSharp joined the RBA officially in December 2021. We are now strengthening related initiatives \nwhile utilizing RBA tools and mechanisms. One such initiative is our use of the RBA e-learning \nAcademy. The academy has been providing employees with a deeper understanding of interna-\ntional CSR standards since February 2022.\nWe also assess the risk of human rights violations through the aforementioned CSR/green pro-\ncurement surveys. As a result of these efforts, we have not identified any serious problems such as \nforced labor or child labor in our supply chain. However, in the unlikely event that a problem such \nas a human rights violation is identified, we will immediately take the necessary corrective and \nrelief measures in consultation with our suppliers based on our agreement. If no improvement is \nexpected, we will take strict measures including suspending transactions.\nSharp is also working to strengthen our grievance-handling mechanism. We established the \nCrystal Hotline, our whistleblowing contact desk, on our external website to receive reports from \nsuppliers and other stakeholders.

Our e-learning environment allows employees to easily learn anytime, anywhere using \ncomputers or smartphones at home, actively helping employees enhance their abilities through \nself-development.\nSharp’s approach to diversity is clearly stated in our Business Philosophy: “It is the intention of our \ncorporation to grow hand-in-hand with our employees, encouraging and aiding them to reach \ntheir full potential and improve their standard of living.” We aim to lead to new value propositions \nby innovating through the mutual respect of individual employee personalities, developing inno-\nvative technologies unique to the Company, and providing services. Diversity management is a \nhuman resources strategy for utilizing a diverse range of employees; it is also a business strategy.\nThe Sharp Code of Conduct states, “In any corporate activities, including employment practices such as \nhiring, compensation, promotion, opportunities for training and the like, we do not take any action that \nconstitutes discrimination based on nationality, race, ethnic group, color, sex, physical health, pregnancy, \nsexual orientation, age, marital status, religion, creed, social status, birth, property, bodily feature, phys-\nical or mental disability, political opinion, and the like,” and that, “We will actively take part in efforts to \nenhance the work environment where employees with diverse characteristics can fully demonstrate their \nabilities.” This is what Sharp is actively working towards, giving individual consideration based on need.\nSharp implements No Overtime Days and encourages all employees to plan for and use annual paid \nleave to establish an efficient and balanced work style. In 2023, we eliminated the requirement for \nemployees to justify their use of the telecommuting system, assuming employees in question is capa-\nble of maintaining or enhancing their productivity. We also increased the number of days per week \nthat the system can be used. At the same time, we expanded flexible hours under the flextime sys-\ntem, establishing a more adaptable work environment regarding location and time.\nFurthermore, we strive to improve work-life balance by expanding and encouraging the use of \nsystems that help employees balance work with childcare, nursing care, and medical treatment. \nFor childcare support, we distribute guidebooks and inform employees about our individual sys-\ntems, resulting in numerous employees utilizing leave for childcare.\nSocial Initiatives\nTalent Management (HITO-oriented Management) \nHuman Resource Development\nDiversity Management\nWork-Life Balance Initiatives\nSee the following for more information on human resources.\nhttps://global.sharp/corporate/eco/social/\nEvolve performance-based \nreward system to support \nyoung generation\n(1) Realize speedy promotion\n based on job responsibility\n(2) Annual salary increase\n  with variation considering\n reward standards\n(3) Bonus system realizing\n higher standards based\n on business performance\nEstablish work treatment \nsystem effective on \ncollecting personnel\n(1) Raise reward level of\n excellent young talent\n observing market standards\n(2) Realize flexible work styles\n and work spots\n(3) Enrich welfare such as \n dorm, canteen, healthcare\n measures etc.\nFulfill methods to support \ndevelopment of personnel\n(1) Enrich education program for\n  next-generation management \n executives / startup training\n(2) Aggressively provide\n opportunities to work\n overseas\n(3) Promote job mobility\n within business groups\nImprove organization \nrejuvenation / decision-\nmaking speed\n(1) Further strengthen \n recruitment\n(2) Aggressively assign young\n employees to key posts\n(3) Promote flattening of \n organizations\nybridH nnovationI alentT pportunityO"}

I even \ncontributed to an alliance with Sharp’s mobile business when I worked for a mobile phones busi-\nness unit. After working in front-line business operations, I moved to corporate functions, where \nI gained experience in legal affairs, intellectual property, human resources development, purpose, \nand sustainability. I aim to contribute to Sharp as an outside director by leveraging my knowledge \nand experience in business transformation, digital transformation, and sustainability transforma-\ntion during a time of VUCA*.\nSharp is executing significant structural reforms, carrying out Asset Light Initiatives to achieve its \nnew growth strategy. This is a pivotal year as the Company stands at the starting line to remain a \ncompany recognized and valued by society for years to come. The Board of Directors engages in \ntransparent and frank discussions, fully aware of the challenging environment and other issues. \nIt goes without saying that I will monitor and advise the progress of these structural reforms. An-\nother area I want to focus on is human resources strategy, which is the driving force of ongoing \ncorporate value enhancement and must be aligned with business strategy.\nSharp’s business philosophy reads, “It is the intention of our corporation to grow hand-in-hand \nwith our employees, encouraging and aiding them to reach their full potential and improve their \nstandard of living.” I aim to contribute as an outside director to support the Company in continu-\ning to practice this philosophy in the context of today’s social environment. For instance, the num-\nber of female employees and the ratio of women in managerial positions remain low. I want the \nexecutive team to raise the quality of management by responding to a society with diverse values, \nenhancing workforce diversity, and listening to diverse voices. I also hope to play an advisory role \nby taking the opportunity to listen to those on the front lines.\nI expect Sharp to swiftly advance efforts to enhance physical, organizational, and institutional \nenvironments, empowering women and other diverse, motivated employees to unlock their poten-\ntial and thrive.\n*VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity\nPursuing Diversity and\nCorporate Value Enhancement\nYumiko Kajiwara\nOutside Director\nCorporate Governance Awareness: \nAn Essential Factor in Managing Listed Companies \nAkira Kiyota\nOutside Director\nAwareness of the importance of corporate governance began to grow in Japan around 2000. \nUnder the second Abe administration beginning late 2012, the “Abenomics” growth strategy \nintroduced initiatives to boost the profitability of Japanese companies and enhance shareholder \nvalue. In response, the Financial Services Agency and Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) formulated \nthe Corporate Governance Code  in March 2015, which went into effect for all listed companies in \nJune 2015. Corporate governance refers to the framework that ensures companies make transpar -\nent, fair, timely, and decisive decisions, taking into account the positions of shareholders, custom-\ners, employees, local communities, and others.\nTransparent and clear management from a shareholder’s perspective backed by compelling man-\nagement visions and strategies is essential for listed companies. Such factors allow listed companies \nto be well-regarded in capital markets and achieve sustainable growth. The Corporate Governance \nCode responds to this need, aiming to improve shareholder returns by supporting management \ncommitted to improving corporate value over the medium- to long-term through constructive \nshareholder dialogue. The Corporate Governance Code adopts a comply or explain  framework to \nencourage companies to either adopt its standards or explain reasons for non-compliance, thereby \npromoting proactive governance. As listed companies face significant shifts in their business envi-\nronments, management must consider ways to achieve sustainable growth and create long-term \ncorporate value, while exploring effective frameworks to achieve these goals. \nThe TSE revised its market segments for the first time since the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the \nOsaka Securities Exchange merged, reclassifying the previous four segments—TSE 1st Section, TSE \n2nd Section, JASDAQ, and Mothers—to clarify segment concepts. The new structure introduces \nthe Prime Market segment, where companies are expected to maintain a higher standard of cor -\nporate governance.\nThe Corporate Governance Code has undergone multiple revisions since its introduction, urging \nmanagement to enhance effectiveness through measures including improving board functionality \nand fostering diversity among core members. The Corporate Governance Code also calls for pro-\nactive efforts to enhance sustainability.\nToday, nearly all executives of companies listed on the Prime Market actively engage in corporate \ngovernance. I am committed to supporting Sharp in their efforts to strengthen corporate governance \nand enhance corporate value."}

In the institutional \ndesign of the company, we have chosen to become a company with an audit & supervisory commit-\ntee. This format increases the agility of our decision-making, while strengthening oversight of the \nexecution of duties.\nWith regard to the execution of business, Sharp separates the supervisory and decision-making \nfunctions from the business execution functions through the introduction of the Executive Officers \nSystem. This system enables the prompt, efficient, and consistent conduct of business. Sharp has also \norganized its business structure by decentralizing management to clarify the profit responsibilities of \neach business unit. In this way we have been strengthening our individual businesses and operations, \nexercising control through the Chairperson’s Office, President’s Office, and the Business Strategy \nPlanning Office, organizations within our headquarters.\nSharp’s corporate governance system comprises the Board of Directors, which supervises directors’ \nexecution of duties, and the Audit & Supervisory Committee, which audits the directors’ execution of \nduties, together with Executive Officers System which separates the supervisory and decision-making \nfunctions from the business execution functions.\nMeetings of the Board of Directors of Sharp Corporation make decisions on matters stipulated by \nlaw and management-related matters of importance, and supervise the state of business execution. \nThe Company also has an Internal Control Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nom-\ninating Committee. These committees serve as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors. In addition, \nimportant transactions between the parent company group and Sharp Group which need to be \nsubmitted for discussion at the Executive Management Meeting are reviewed and approved by the \nBoard of Directors, the majority of whom are independent outside directors, to determine the neces-\nsity, rationality, and appropriateness of the transaction in question.\nIn addition to the Board of Directors, the Company has set up an Executive Management Committee \nwhose members are executive officers. The Executive Management Meeting deliberates in an appropriate \nand timely manner on matters of importance related to corporate management and business operations. \nThis committee facilitates prompt executive decision-making.\nThe Audit & Supervisory Committee is comprised of three directors, all of whom are outside di-\nrectors having high levels of professional knowledge. Two of the Audit & Supervisory Committee \nmembers are independent directors and one member is a full-time Audit & Supervisory Committee \nmember. The Audit & Supervisory Committee members hold regular meetings with executive direc-\ntors, accounting auditors, the head of the Internal Audit Division and others to exchange opinions \nand endeavor to ensure that business is conducted legally, appropriately, and efficiently.\nStatus of Corporate Governance System  (As of June 28, 2024)\nSupervisory/decision-making\nfunctions\nAudit\nfunctions\nOrdinary General Meeting of Shareholders\nSupplement\nReport\nReport\nReport\nMonitoring\nCoordination\nAudit/\nsupervision\nElection/dismissal Election/dismissal\nSupervision/decision-making Audit\nCompensation\nCommittee\nInternal Control\nCommittee\nInternal Audit\nDivision\nAudit & Supervisory\nCommittee Ofﬁce\nBoard of Directors\nDirectors\nAudit & Supervisory\nCommittee\nAudit & Supervisory\nCommittee Members\n(Directors)\nNominating\nCommittee\nElection/dismissal\nSupplement\nAssist\nCoordination\nAccounting\nauditors\nCoordination\nBusiness\nexecution\nfunctions\nBusiness Execution Unit\nOperational\naudit\nElection/dismissal\nAppointment/removal/\nsupervisionRaise discussed\nmatters/report\nDeliberation on key policies\nExecutive\nManagement Meeting\nExecutives\nExecutive Directors\nAudit Accounting\naudit\nRaise discussed matters\nOrganization Membership (  : Committee chair) (As of June 28, 2024)\nTitle Name Bord of \nDirectors\nAudit & \nSupervisory \nCommittee\nExecutive \nManagement \nMeeting\nNominating \nCommittee\nCompensation \nCommittee\nInternal \nControl \nCommittee\nDeputy Chairman, Member of the Board Po-Hsuan Wu ◎ ○ ○ ○ ○\nPresident & CEO, Member of the Board Masahiro Okitsu ○ ◎ ○ ○ ◎\nMember of the Board(Outside Director) Akira Kiyota ○ ○ ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director) Ching-Ray Chang ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director) Seiichi Nagatsuka ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director) Yumiko Kajiwara ○ ○ ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director)* Hsu-Tung Lu ○ ◎ ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director)* Yasuo Himeiwa ○ ○ ○\nMember of the Board(Outside Director)* Yutaka Nakagawa ○ ○ ◎ ◎ ○\nSenior Executive Managing Officer, CFO Yoshio Kosaka ○ ○\nSenior Executive Managing Officer, CTO Mototaka Taneya ○\nExecutive Managing Officer Yasufumi Sugahara ○\nExecutive Managing Officer Tetsuji Kawamura ○\nExecutive Officer Yoshiro Nakano ○\nExecutive Officer Katsuhiro Kawai ○\n* Member of Audit & Supervisory Committee\nCorporate Governance\nStatus of Corporate Governance System"}

Sharp is currently engaged in the development and operation \nof internal control systems in accordance with this Basic Policy. The Internal Control Committee, \nwhich serves as an advisory body to the Board of Directors, deliberates on basic policies regarding \ninternal controls, internal audits, and the status of internal controls-related policies and operations. \nThe committee reports on or refers matters to the Board of Directors as necessary. Sharp has estab-\nlished departments to supervise and implement measures and initiatives related to internal controls \non a company-wide basis. Sharp has also established an independent internal audit division to evalu-\nate the effectiveness of internal control and provide feedback on a continuing basis.\nTo enhance compliance throughout the Group, Sharp introduced the Sharp Group Charter of \nCorporate Behavior, a set of principles to guide corporate behavior, and the Sharp Code of Con-\nduct, which clarifies the conduct expected of all directors, executives, and employees of Sharp. \nDisseminating these throughout the Company and conducting annual trainings fosters a mindset \nof preventing problems before they occur. In accordance with the basic rules of compliance, Sharp \nis also developing a company-wide compliance promotion system. Sharp is also formulating the \nSharp Group Compliance Guidebook which points out specific standards for items to be observed, \nprohibited items, and actions to be taken by all directors, executives, and employees. This is being \nprovided to the whole company in order to ensure thorough compliance.\nOn the subject of compliance-related whistleblowing systems, we have established the Crystal \nHotline to handle various issues regarding compliance, including organizational or individual viola-\ntions of the law or ethics at Sharp or domestic subsidiaries as well as the Competition Law Hotline \nto handle issues regarding competition laws. These hotlines have been established both internally \nand externally (making use of advisory law firm services) in keeping with the Whistleblower Protec-\ntion Act and may be used by any employees or temporary employees of the Sharp Group in Japan, \nor employees of its business partners, etc*. In addition, our major overseas bases have also estab-\nlished similar whistleblowing and consultation facilities.\nTo deal comprehensively and systematically with a wide range of business risks, Sharp formulat-\ned its Business Risk Management Guidelines for the prevention of risk and for the swift response \nto any emerging risks.\n*Business partners may only use the Crystal Hotline.\nRegarding remuneration for directors (excluding directors on the Audit & Supervisory Committee), the \nOrdinary General Meeting of Shareholders, held June 27, 2024, resolved to cap cash remuneration at \n¥500 million per fiscal year (of which a maximum of ¥100 million may be paid to outside directors).\nThe Company grants restricted stock as nonmonetary remuneration or stock acquisition rights as \nstock options to directors, up to a limit of ¥300 million (150,000 shares or 1,500 units) per fiscal \nyear, of which a maximum of ¥30 million (15,000 shares or 150 units) may be granted to outside di-\nrectors. This allows us to better align values between Sharp directors and shareholders, as well as to \nstrengthen the sense of responsibility and increase motivation related to corporate performance.\nThe Compensation Committee, delegated authority by the Board of Directors, determines mone-\ntary remuneration for individual directors (excluding members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee) \nwithin the scope approved by the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. The Compensation \nCommittee provides advice regarding nonmonetary remuneration, which is determined by a resolu-\ntion of the Board of Directors in consideration of said advice.\nMonetary remuneration is limited to ¥100 million per fiscal year for directors who are Audit & Su-\npervisory Committee members per resolution of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders, held \nJune 29, 2021.\nTo better align values between Sharp directors who are members of the Audit & Supervisory Com-\nmittee and shareholders, the Company grants restricted stock as nonmonetary remuneration sepa-\nrate from the framework for monetary remuneration to directors who are members of the Audit & \nSupervisory Committee, up to a limit of ¥60 million (30,000 shares) per fiscal year. This remuneration \nis designed to improve a greater awareness of the need for complete and comprehensive audits, to \nprevent loss of corporate value, and to maintain trust in the Company.\nThe Ordinary Meeting of General Shareholders approves the scope of monetary and nonmonetary \nremuneration for individual directors who are members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, the \namounts of which are then determined according to discussions among directors who are members \nof the Audit & Supervisory Committee.\nRemuneration, etc. for Sharp directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit & Su-\npervisory Committee) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 was ¥218 million (five directors, in -\ncluding one director who retired during the term).

{"doc_id": "sharp_annual_2024e", "title": "sharp_annual_2024e.pdf", "page": 24, "text": "Sharp Annual Report 2024\n22\nListed below are the principal business risks \nof Sharp that may have a significant influence \non investors’ decisions and countermeasures.\nNote that in addition to these, there exist \ncertain other risks that are difficult to foresee.\nEach of these risks has the potential to \nimpact the operations, business results, and \nfinancial position of Sharp.\nAll references to possible future develop-\nments in the following text were made by \nSharp as of March 31, 2024 (or June 28, 2024 \nas appropriate).\n(1) Global market trends and overseas businesses\n(Risk)\nSharp conducts our business not only in Japan but \nalso in different regions around the world. Business \nresults and financial position are thus subject to eco-\nnomic trends (especially private consumption and \ncorporate capital investment trends), competition \nwith other companies, product demand, raw mate-\nrial supply, and price fluctuations in each region \naround the world, including Japan.\nIn addition, various factors may have negative \nimpacts on Sharp performance and financial position. \nSuch factors include persistent global inflation, pro-\nlonged monetary tightening in Europe and the U.S. \nputting potential downward pressure on demand \nfor durable consumer goods, and sluggish con-\nsumer spending in China due to the stagnant real \nestate market.\n(Countermeasure)\nBusiness units that control Sharp’s overseas \nsubsidiaries collect risk and other information that \nmay impact Sharp’s operations, including global \nmarket trends, in cooperation with their local offices \nand make necessary operational decisions. Business \nresults of the overseas subsidiaries and business units \nare reported to management regularly, determin-\ning the necessary risk responses on a case-by-case \nbasis by analyzing the latest circumstances.\n(2) Exchange rate fluctuations\n(Risk)\nThe proportion of consolidated net sales accounted \nfor by overseas sales was 68.6% in fiscal 2022 and \n66.7% in fiscal 2023. Sharp sells products made \noverseas in the Japanese market, and also sells prod-\nucts in countries where it does not manufacture the \nproducts. Therefore, Sharp’s business results may \nbe impacted by exchange rate fluctuations.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp hedges the risk of exchange rate fluctuations \nby employing forward exchange contracts and \nexpanding and strengthening optimally located \nproduction.\n(3)  Dependence on certain businesses,  \nproducts, and clients\n(Risk)\nSharp’s device businesses account for nearly half \nof Sharp’s sales. Accordingly, Sharp’s earnings may \nbe impacted negatively by factors including slow-\ning customer demand for related products, falling \nproduct prices, or increasing competition due to \nthe emergence of substitute or competitive prod-\nucts, or the emergence of new competitors.\nSharp’s device businesses have high dependence \non a small number of specific clients for the sales \nof some of their products. Sharp’s business results \nand financial position could be affected if sales to \nsuch important clients languish due to not only  \nfactors related to Sharp’s products but reasons \noutside of Sharp’s control. These include declin-\ning demand for the clients’ products, changes in \nproduct specifications, and changes in the clients’ \nsales strategies.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp aims to gain superior competitive advan-\ntages by accelerating a business model shift \nachieved by launching new high value-added ser -\nvice solutions; accelerating the global business \nexpansion and developing the business to the \nB2C and B2B markets, in addition to maintaining \nand expanding the existing business segments by \nexpanding the traditional hardware business.\n(4) Strategic alliances and collaborations\n(Risk)\nSharp has forged strategic alliances and collabora-\ntions with other companies in order to enhance \ncorporate competitiveness, improve profitability, \nand bolster the development of new technolo-\ngies and products in various business fields. If, \nhowever, any strategic issues with such strategic \npartners or other business issues arise, or goals \nchange, it may become difficult to maintain \nsuch alliances and collaborative ties with these \ncompanies, or to generate adequate results. In \nsuch cases, Sharp’s business results and financial \nposition may be impacted.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp believes that importance of strategic alli-\nances and collaborations will grow in the future. \nTo lead them to success, Sharp thoroughly verifies \nthe strategic necessity of the business, profitabil-\nity, and financial appropriateness at the stage of \nfeasibility study of strategic alliances and collabo -\nrations, and makes decisions after deliberation at \nthe Executive Management Meeting and the Board \nof Directors.\nAfter executing them, Sharp monitors the prog-\nress of the alliances and collaborations under close \ncooperation with the relevant business units, and \nreports to management early if it is determined \nthat the expected results cannot be achieved, to \nensure that measures can be taken to minimize \nthe impact they may have on Sharp’s business \nresults and financial position.\n(5) Relations with parent company group\n(Risk)\nThe equity investments from our parent company \ngroup (including Hon Hai Precision Industry, sub-\nsidiaries, and affiliates) allowed Sharp to invest in \ngrowth, and to pursue operational synergies using \nthe technological, productivity, and cost capa-\nbilities of our parent company group. However, \nwe cannot guarantee that operational synergies \nbetween Sharp and the parent company group \nwill occur as envisioned.\nRisk Factors"}
{"doc_id": "sharp_annual_2024e", "title": "sharp_annual_2024e.pdf", "page": 25, "text": "Sharp Annual Report 2024\n23\nA change in the parent company group’s busi-\nness strategies or competitive relationship with \nthe parent company group arising in the future \nmay adversely affect Sharp’s operations, business \nresults, and financial position.\nDecision making of important matters, such as \nmanagement policy and business development \nmay be biased by the parent company group and \nmaintaining our independence and autonomy \nmay not be possible.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp conducts business operations by maximiz-\ning operational synergies with the parent company \ngroup while fully respecting independence and \nautonomy between both entities and in close coop-\neration with the parent company group. Sharp \nidentifies areas where Sharp can create synergy \neffects with the parent company group, such as its \noperational efficiency improvement and expansion \nof its sales and profits, and Sharp appropriately \nverifies the expected synergies in those areas in \ncooperation with the parent company group in an \neffort to implement them.\nThe parent company group engages mainly in \noutsourced production of electronic equipment. \nThe Sharp Group handles the manufacturing and \nsales of telecommunications equipment, electri-\ncal appliances, and general electronics application \nequipment and components under the Sharp and \nother brands. Therefore, Sharp believes that there \nis no competition in the parent company group \nthat may impact Sharp’s operations.\nSharp strives to grow, develop, and improve its \nperformance in close cooperation with the parent \ncompany group, while fully respecting indepen-\ndence and autonomy between both entities. Sharp \nrecognizes that working together with the parent \ncompany group to increase Sharp’s operational \nefficiency and expand its sales and profits will ben-\nefit the interests of non-controlling shareholders.\n(6) Dealings with suppliers\n(Risk)\nSharp procures materials and receives services from \na large number of business partners. However, there \nis a risk that business partners may suffer deteriora-\ntion in performance due to slumping demand or \nsevere price erosion, unexpected M&A, or natural \ndisasters or accidents. They may also be affected \nby the U.S.-China trade friction, the situation in \nUkraine, labor costs, rising raw materials prices and \nenergy costs, legal regulations concerning human \nrights, environmental issues such as the problem \nof conflict minerals in the supply chain, or limited \nsuppliers with the capability of providing certain \nmaterial provisions. Due to these and other factors, \nSharp may be unable to access sufficient supplies of \nmaterials/parts from procurement sources.\nIn such an event, Sharp may be forced to do \nbusiness with alternative suppliers subject to condi-\ntions less favorable than with its current suppliers, \nor Sharp may be unable to find an alternative sup-\nplier in a timely manner. Any of these factors could \nlead to increases in costs and/or delays in deliveries \nto customers, which may adversely affect Sharp’s \nbusiness results and financial position.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp conducts business with suppliers after car -\nrying out thorough credit checks. Additionally, \nSharp has introduced a supply chain CSR manage-\nment system to address risks in the supply chain, \nand regularly evaluates suppliers at domestic and \noverseas production sites, providing thorough \neducation and guidance. Furthermore, in order \nto ensure a stable supply of parts and materials \nand to optimize costs of procurement, Sharp is \nstrengthening partnerships with suppliers such as \nfor long-term quotas, and is also promoting pur -\nchasing from multiple companies.\n(7) Other factors affecting financial position\n(Risk)\nSharp raises funds through borrowings from finan-\ncial institutions such as banks. The debt to total \nassets ratio is 36.1% as of fiscal year ending March \n31, 2024. Sharp might become subject to restric-\ntions on how it uses its cash flows in order to repay \ndebt, and also face the possibility of an increase in \nexpenses due to rising interest rates. Sharp has the \npossibility of increases in fund raising costs as well \nas limitations on fund raising. This may be because \nnecessary funds cannot be raised at the required \ntime with adequate conditions, including for the \nrefinancing of existing debt. These factors may \naffect Sharp’s business results and financial position.\nSharp has borrowing agreements with multiple \nfinancial institutions, and some of the agreements \nentail financial covenants. Sharp may forfeit the \nbenefit of time with respect to such borrowings at \nthe request of the lender’s financial institution due \nto any of the following reasons: (1) If consolidated \nnet assets fall below the levels specified under such \nfinancial covenants, (2) if Sharp fails to undertake \nfaithful consultations in the event that its consoli-\ndated operating profit and profit attributable to \nowners of parent fall below specified levels, (3) if its \nconsolidated ordinary profit cannot be kept at cer-\ntain levels, or (4) if Sharp or any of our consolidated \nsubsidiaries becomes excess liabilities.\nSharp’s dependence on borrowings, credit rat-\nings reduction caused by it, or deterioration of \nSharp’s financial position may work to its disad-\nvantage with respect to competition with other \ncompanies with robust financial positions, and \ncontract-related issues could also arise between \nSharp and its lenders or business partners.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp’s major lending institutions are Mizuho Bank, \nLtd. and MUFG Bank, Ltd. As necessary, Sharp \nconsults with both banks about ways to improve \nits financial position and other matters. Sharp also \nshares information about its financial position with \nother financial institutions with which Sharp has \nborrowing agreements. Sharp has a system in place \nto discuss matters when necessary, keeps good \nrelations with its correspondent financial institu-\ntions, and maintains and continues borrowings.\nTo procure stable funding, the Company syndi-\ncated loan agreement, which is the main borrowing \nagreement for the Group, is a long-term loan agree-\nment through April 2026. We also entered into \ncommitment line agreements with two main banks \ntotaling 200 billion yen in loans.\nRisk Factors"}

As a \nresult, net loss attributable to owners of the parent \namounted to 149,980 million yen and consolidated \nnet assets decreased to 157,424 million yen, down \n29.2% year on year. Sharp consolidated net assets \nand consolidated ordinary income fell below a cer-\ntain level, resulting in the Company and certain \nconsolidated subsidiaries having excess liabilities \nat the end of fiscal 2023. This situation violated \nthe financial covenants outlined in the loan agree-\nment. However, the lending institutions have \nagreed not to make this claim for forfeiture, and \nwe expect to continue our good business relation-\nship with the lender as in the past. \nSharp has implemented structural reforms, \nincluding production halt at Sakai Display Products \nCorporation, in the large-size display business and \nproduction capacity reduction and personnel opti-\nmization, in the small- and medium-size display \nbusiness, both of which contributed to the losses.\nAt the same time, we will continue our efforts to \nenhance profitability by creating distinctive prod-\nucts and new product categories and strengthening \noverseas businesses in the brand businesses.\nWe determined that there are no significant \nconcerns about cash flow in working capital and \ninvestment funds for the time being, as the impair-\nment loss is not one that involves an outflow of \nfunds and we achieved a total of 135,371 million \nyen in free cash flow, the sum of cash flows from \noperating and investing activities. Although events \nand circumstances exist that may raise significant \ndoubts about our premise of a going concern, \nno significant uncertainties have been identified. \nAs such, Notes Related to the Going Concern \nAssumption is not applicable.\n(8) Technological innovation\n(Risk)\nRapid technological advancement and proper \nresponse to changes in the business areas where \nSharp operates improves the competitiveness of \nSharp’s products and services, whereas insufficient \nresponse to the following items may adversely \naffect the growth and business results.\n•  Prediction and response to the technological \nadvancement and rise and fall, and their social \nsignificance\n•  Selection and concentration in R&D, and proper \nresource allocation\n•  Technological enhancement for new areas\n•  Acceleration of R&D in collaboration with exter-\nnal partners\nIn addition, there are moves to strengthen export \ncontrol of advanced technologies from the perspec-\ntive of international security. Export restrictions on \nproducts containing more than a certain amount of \nadded value from the targeted technologies could \nhave an indirect impact on our business.\n(Countermeasure)\nGroup research and development is not limited to \nmere improvement of technological standards, but \nalso focuses on creating technologies that solve \nissues arising with rapid changes in society. We \nfocus particularly on the application and devel-\nopment of Edge AI technology in growth areas \nsuch as carbon neutrality, industry digital trans-\nformation, and digital healthcare. We advance the \ncreation of new services and solutions by effec-\ntively utilizing our business foundation built to \ndate to promptly implement necessary technolo-\ngies in society. We also work to strengthen our \ntechnological capabilities and accelerate devel-\nopment through active collaboration outside the \nCompany. Through these initiatives, Sharp reduces \nrisks associated with social changes and techno-\nlogical innovations, and aims to become a brand \ncompany that continues to grow sustainably \nthrough technological advancement.\nIn addition to complying with export and import \ncontrol laws and regulations in the operational \nactivities, Sharp executes control for export and \nimport in conformance with laws and regulations \nas well as regulatory situation in each country \nand region in R&D to deal with the tightening of \ncontrol of emerging technologies involving social \nplatforms for global infrastructure, defense, secu-\nrity, and so on.\n(9) Intellectual property rights\n(Risk)\nSharp strives to protect its unique technologies by \nacquiring intellectual property rights in Japan and \nin other countries, and by concluding contracts \nwith other companies. There may also be instances \nin which no rights are granted to the group’s pat-\nent applications, or where a third party launches \nlitigation against Sharp, claiming infringement of \nintellectual property rights. \nResolution of cases may place a significant finan-\ncial burden on Sharp. Furthermore, if a third party \nclaim against Sharp is recognized, Sharp may be \nsubject to damages, including by having to pay a \nlarge amount of compensation, or by having to \ncease using the technology in question.\nIn addition, intellectual property that Sharp \nholds may not result in a superior competitive \nadvantage, or Sharp may not be able to make \neffective use of such intellectual property, such \nas when a third party infringes on the intellectual \nproperty rights of Sharp.\nIf any of the above problems related to intellec-\ntual property rights were to occur, it could impact \nSharp’s business results and financial position.\n(Countermeasure)\nUnder recognition that the intellectual property \nrights are important assets for a company, Sharp \nstrives to actively create intellectual properties, \nand tries to acquire strong rights by mainly using \nSharp’s subsidiary Sharp IP Infinity Co., Ltd., its \nintellectual property rights application and acqui-\nsition division.\nBefore releasing its products, Sharp checks the \nclearance of intellectual property rights by thor -\noughly checking the intellectual property rights of \nthird parties, and at the same time, Sharp improves \nclearance accuracy by standardizing the clearance \nprocess. Thus, Sharp implements measures against \nRisk Factors"}

If defects \narise in any of these products, Sharp may incur \nresponsibility as a manufacturer and other obligations.\nThere is a risk of a large-scale product recall or \nlitigation caused by unforeseen events, which may \nadversely affect Sharp’s brand image or influence \nits business results and financial position.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp not only complies with public safety stan-\ndards in each country to ensure the safety of its \nproducts but also improves safety by combining the \nrisk assessment policy with its unique safety criteria. \nTo ensure safety even if an unexpected problem \narises, in particular criteria for inflammable struc-\nture, malfunction test, etc. were established, \nand they are revised when necessary to pursue a \nhigher level of safety, and training is performed \nfor internal stakeholders to ensure that the safety \ncriteria are understood and shared by the design \nand quality departments. Sharp has established \na system to ensure safety to make sure that an \nemergency action can be taken quickly and appro-\npriately when a problem arises. In order to fulfill \nits responsibility as a manufacturer in case product \ndefects do arise, Sharp has taken out insurance \nto cover compensations based on product liability.\n(11) Competition to secure skilled personnel\n(Risk)\nFailure to secure skilled personnel in the technol-\nogy and management fields could affect Sharp’s \nbusiness results and financial position.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp implements the following measures to \nsecure skilled personnel in the technology and \nmanagement fields.\nSharp actively hires new graduates in order to \nacquire new talents according to its business policies. \nSharp also actively hires experienced personnel in \norder to secure core personnel responsible for new \nbusinesses.\nSharp created education and training programs \nthat allow all employees to acquire basic and \nprofessional knowledge by self-driven learning \nto develop professional personnel who can fulfill \ntheir professional duties.\nAs a platform where diverse human resources \ncan work with peace of mind, Sharp actively imple-\nments initiatives in consideration of the work-life \nbalance of employees, such as creating various \nprograms to strike a balance between work and \nchild upbringing/care/treatment.\n(12) The impact of climate change\n(Risk)\nGroup business results and financial position could \nbe affected by stricter regulations on greenhouse \ngas emissions, increased energy costs associated \nwith the introduction of a carbon tax, and tighter \nmeasures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In \naddition, disasters caused by increasingly larger \ntyphoons and greater precipitation due to climate \nchange may cause production sites to suspend \noperations or interrupt parts supply.\n(Countermeasure)\nSharp ensures compliance with existing regula-\ntions and standards. In addition, we strive to remain \nabreast of legal and regulatory trends and par -\nticipate in policy-making opportunities. We also \nendeavor to reduce or minimize our cost burden by \nimproving production efficiency and energy con-\nservation. Further, Sharp has formulated a business \ncontinuity plan in the event that production sites \nor employees suffer damage from natural disas-\nters. We maintain and improve our organization’s \nbusiness continuity capabilities through regular \nreviews and drills.\nIn addition to the risks above, there are various \npotential risks, including a risk of dealing with a \nlarge number of clients, capital investment risk, \nregulatory risk, or large-scale natural disaster risk. \nThere are other potential risks that are not men-\ntioned in this section which may adversely affect \nSharp’s business results and financial position.\n(Risk management system)\nSharp sees the risk management as “one of the \nimportant activities to fulfill our social responsi-\nbilities by growing the business sustainably and \nmeeting the expectations of our stakeholders.” \nSpecifically, Sharp has established the Business Risk \nManagement Guidelines as basic rules for the risk \nmanagement, created a company-wide risk man-\nagement system in line with the guidelines, and \nselected risks that have significant impact on the \nbusiness as “specific risks” and manages them.\nTo respond to changes in the business and \nmarket environments, Sharp considers adding or \nchanging specific risks every fiscal year for all spe-\ncific risks, evaluating and reviewing the added or \nchanged specific risks. The functional department \nthat manages company-wide risks works together \nwith business units in charge of managing their \nbusiness segments to minimize and mitigate \nrisks and take the necessary measures to prevent \nthem. In addition, in case a specific risk arises, the \ndepartment where the incident arises reports it to \nthe internal control department that serves as risk \nmanagement secretariat as well as management, \nworks together with the relevant departments \nto respond to the relevant incident, and, when \nnecessary, considers company-wide improvement \nmeasures to prevent recurrence.\nRisk Factors"}

Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n(a) Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of Sharp Corporation (“the Company”) have been \nprepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange \nAct and its related accounting regulations and in conformity with accounting principles generally \naccepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and \ndisclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).\nThe financial statements of the Company’s overseas consolidated subsidiaries for consolidation \npurposes have been prepared in conformity with IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles in the \nUnited States of America (“US GAAP”), with adjustments for the specified five items where applicable \naccording to Practical Issues Task Force No. 18 “Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies \nApplied to Foreign Subsidiaries for Consolidated Financial Statements”.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated into English (with no \nreclassifications) from the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance \nwith Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as \nrequired by the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.\nIn preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes, Japanese yen figures less \nthan one million yen have been rounded down to the nearest million yen. Therefore, total or subtotal \namounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are not \nnecessarily equal to the sum of individually presented amounts.\n(b) Principles of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 116 \ncompanies over which the Company has power of control through the holding of majority voting rights \nor with the existence of other certain conditions. Investments in 1 nonconsolidated subsidiary and 12 \naffiliates on which the Company has significant influence regarding their operating and financial policies \nare accounted for using equity method.\nChanges in the consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(Included in scope)\nSHARP FRONTIER ELECTRONICS DEVICE PTE.

In principle, revenue from these transactions is \nrecognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of products delivered by the Group \nas the performance obligation is deemed to have been satisfied by then. At that point in time, the legal \ntitle to the products, physical possession, and significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products \nare transferred to the customer, and the Group is entitled to receive payment for the transaction. For \nsome domestic sales, revenue is recognized upon shipment if the period of time from the shipment to \nthe completion of the transfer of control of the products to the customer is considered to be normal.\nThe Group is also engaged in contracted construction in addition to maintenance and warranty \nservices that are mainly related to products. In these transactions, the Group transfers goods or services \nto customers over time to satisfy performance obligations. Thus, in principle, revenue is recognized \naccording to the degree of progress towards complete satisfaction or over time for the service period.\nRevenue is measured in the amount of consideration that the Group expects to be entitled in return \nfor the transfer of products or services to the customers (hereinafter, “transaction price”).

The amount of a variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the \nextent that it is highly probable that the subsequent resolution of uncertainty concerning the amount \nof the variable consideration will not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized \nuntil then.\nWhen multiple performance obligations, such as product and warranty services, are identifiable in a \ncontract, a transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation primarily based on the ratio of \nobservable stand-alone selling prices.\nIf a product warranty provides a customer with a service beyond the assurance that the product \ncomplies with agreed-upon specifications, it is treated as a separate performance obligation. A portion \nof the transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation and revenue is recognized over the \nextended warranty period.\nThe Group determines whether it acts as a principal or an agent in a transaction based on whether the \nGroup controls the promised product or service before transferring to the customer. When the Group is \ndeemed to be involved as an agent, the Group recognizes revenue at the net amount of consideration \nthat the Group retains after paying the other party the consideration received in exchange for goods or \nservices to be provided by that party.\nConsiderations for transactions related to the sale of products, etc., contracted construction, and the \nprovision of warranty or other services are usually received within approximately one year from the time \neach performance obligation is satisfied. The Group applies the exemption rule to these contracts, and \nno adjustments for financing components have been made.\n(o) Significant hedge accounting methods\n(1) Deferred and other hedge accounting methods\nThe Company uses deferred hedge accounting for foreign exchange forward contracts for certain \nconsolidated subsidiaries and interest rate swaps of the Company. The allocation method is used for \nforeign exchange forward contracts that meet the requirements for the allocation method, and special \naccounting is used for interest rate swaps that meet the requirements for special accounting.\n(2) Hedging instruments and hedged items\na. Hedging instrument: Foreign exchange forward contracts\nHedged items: Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (mainly receivables and \npayables related to export and import transactions)\nb. Hedging instrument: interest rate swaps\nHedged items: Borrowings with variable interest rates\n(3) Hedging policy\nForeign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge the exchange rate fluctuation risks associated \nwith assets and liabilities in accordance with the Company’s internal rules or the basic rules established \nunder the Company’s guidance. Furthermore, the Company uses interest rate swaps in order to hedge \nthe interest rate fluctuation risks associated with borrowings from financial institutions.\n(4) Method for evaluating hedge effectiveness\nAn evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted because the major conditions of the hedging \ninstruments and the hedged items are consistent and the market fluctuations or cash flow fluctuations \nare assumed to be completely offset at the time of commencement of the hedge and thereafter on \nan ongoing basis.\n(p) Method and period for amortization of goodwill\nGoodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over the expected life. Goodwill recorded in the \nconsolidated subsidiaries in the U.S.A. is amortized by the straight-line method over 10 years.\nHowever, if the amount of goodwill is insignificant, the entire amount is amortized during the fiscal \nyear in which the goodwill arises.\n(q) Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows\nCash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows comprise cash on hand, demand \ndeposits in banks, and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or \nless for which the risks of fluctuations in value are not considered to be significant.\n(r) Major accounting estimates\n(1) Valuation of inventories\ni)  Amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 were \nas follows:\nYen (millions)\n2023 2024\nInventories ¥ 299,307 ¥ 269,584\nii) Information related to the contents of major accounting estimates for identified items\nThe Group reduces the book value of inventories when the net realizable value falls below the book \nvalue. In addition, some inventories deemed slow-moving for more than a certain period of time are \ndevalued regularly over time, assuming that it becomes less possible for those inventories to be sold. \nMoreover, the book value of some inventories is also devalued individually when they are deemed \ndifficult to sell.\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n37"}

Some notes and accounts receivable \nare denominated in foreign currencies because the Company conducts business globally and, therefore, \nare exposed to foreign currency risks. Notes and accounts payable - trade and electronically recorded \nobligations - operating are due within one year. Some notes and accounts payable arising from the \nimport of raw materials, etc. are denominated in foreign currencies and, therefore, are exposed to foreign \ncurrency risks. The Company makes use of forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency \nrisk exposure on the net position of foreign currency denominated notes and accounts receivable and \nnotes and accounts payable.\nOther securities are held for long term to develop better business alliances and relationships with the \nCompany’s customers and suppliers, and are exposed to market price fluctuation risks. The main purpose \nof long-term borrowings is to procure funds necessary for capital investments. The longest repayment \nterm is 13 years and 4 months from March 31, 2024.\nDerivative transactions consist primarily of forward exchange contracts, which are used to hedge \nforeign currency risk exposure, and interest rate swaps to hedge against the risk of fluctuations in \ninterest rates on borrowings. For hedging instruments, hedged items, hedging policies and assessment \nmethods of effectiveness of hedging instruments, see “(o) Significant hedge accounting methods” in “1. \nSummary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies.”\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n50"}

{"doc_id": "sharp_annual_2024e", "title": "sharp_annual_2024e.pdf", "page": 69, "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(b) Basic information for understanding revenue from contracts with customers\n(1) Product sales\nThe Group manufactures and sells telecommunications equipment, electrical equipment, and electronic \napplication equipment as “brand business” (white goods such as refrigerators, washing machines, and \nair conditioners in the Smart Life & Energy segment; digital multi-function printers, personal computers, \netc. in the Smart Office segment; and mobile phones, televisions, etc. in the Universal Network segment). \nThe Group also manufactures and sells electronic components as “device business” (display modules, \netc. in the Display Device segment; and camera modules, etc. in the Electronic Device segment).\nIn principle, revenue from these transactions is recognized at the point when the customer obtains \ncontrol of products delivered by the Group as the performance obligation is deemed to have been \nsatisfied then. At that point in time, the legal title to the products, physical possession, and significant \nrisks and rewards of the ownership of the products are transferred to the customer, and the Group is \nentitled to receive payment for the transaction. For some domestic sales, revenue is recognized upon \nshipment if the period of time from the shipment to the transfer of control of the products to the \ncustomer is considered to be normal.\nRevenue is measured at the amount of consideration that the Group expects to be entitled (hereinafter, \n“transaction price”) in return for transfer of products or services to customers. The Group deducts \nsales rebates paid primarily to retailers from revenue. In this way, in determining a transaction price, \nif the consideration promised to the customer includes a variable component (hereinafter, “variable \nconsideration”), the transaction price is estimated by subtracting any variable considerations. The amount \nof a variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable \nthat the subsequent resolution of uncertainty concerning the amount of the variable consideration will \nnot result in a significant reversal in revenue.\nIn addition, the Group has product warranty obligations under product sales agreements to repair \nor replace defective products free of charge within a certain period of time. Such warranty obligations \nprovide assurance to the customer that the product will perform as intended in accordance with the \nspecifications set forth in the agreement with the customer, and are therefore recognized as a provision \nfor product warranties.\n(2) Construction contracts\nIn the Energy Solutions business (“Other” in the Smart Life & Energy segment), the Group enters into \nconstruction contracts that include design and construction of solar power plants. In such contracts, the \nperformance obligation is deemed to be satisfied over time as the construction progresses, and revenue is \nrecognized according to the degree of progress made in satisfying that performance obligation. The degree \nof progress is measured by the Input method, which uses the ratio of the cost incurred to the estimated \ntotal cost of each contract.\nHowever, for construction contracts that have a very short period of time from the contract \ncommencement date to the date when the performance obligation is expected to be fully satisfied, the \nGroup does not recognize revenue over time, but upon a completion of an acceptance inspection because \nthe performance obligation is deemed to have been satisfied at that point in time.\n(3) Services\nThe Group offers maintenance contracts and product warranty services associated with (1) Product sales \ncontracts and (2) Construction contracts. For maintenance contracts, the Group provides maintenance \nservices over the contract period and recognizes revenue according to the contract period. In some cases, \nan extended warranty contract is concluded as product warranty services, separately from the normal \nproduct warranties provided in accordance with agreed-upon specifications. In such cases, the Group \nrecognizes revenue over the extended warranty period because the performance obligation of the product \nwarranty services is satisfied over time.\n(4) Licensing\nThe Group receives consideration for patent licensing by entering into an agreement that permits a \ncustomer to manufacture or sell the Group’s products or use its technologies.\nRevenue from licensing is recognized over time if the nature of the Group’s promise in granting the \nlicense to the customer is the right to access the intellectual property over the term of the license. If it \nis the right to use the intellectual property at the point of time when the license is granted, revenue is \nrecognized at that point.\nIn addition, for sales-based or usage-based royalties, amount and timing to recognize revenue is based \non the sales amounts, etc. and timing recognized on the licensee side.\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n67"}

Segment Information\n(a) General information about reportable segments\nThe Group’s reportable segments are components of the Group for which discrete financial information \nis available and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors. The Board uses \nthis information to make decisions about resources to be allocated among the segments and to assess \nsegment performance.\nThe Group makes company-wide efforts to expand business through the development of new \nproducts, new markets, and new businesses, and to build a stronger management structure. Moreover, \nwe work toward building a business promotion system centered on brand businesses by accelerating \nthe creation of new businesses and developing innovative technologies and devices to “Be a Game \nChanger.” To achieve these goals, we concentrate on three brand businesses: Smart Life & Energy, Smart \nOffice, and Universal Network, as well as on the two device businesses, Display Device and Electronic \nDevice, as reportable segments.\nIn the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we categorized the Group’s reportable segments into five \nsegments: Smart Life, 8K Ecosystem, ICT, Display Device, and Electronic Device. Effective from the fiscal \nyear ended March 31, 2024, we have recategorized reportable segments into five segments: Smart Life \n& Energy, Smart Office, Universal Network, Display Device, and Electronic Device.\nSharp Annual Report 2024\n68"}
