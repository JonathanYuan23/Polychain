The January 26, 2025 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required byU.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation ofresults of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results\nexpected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes theretoincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.\nCertain balances from the prior fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.\nFiscal Year\nFiscal years 2026 and 2025 are both 52-week years ending on the last Sunday in January. The second quarters of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were both 13-week quarters.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balancesand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reportedamounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, includingthose related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other\ncharges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe arereasonable.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of\ninformation in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We are currently assessing theeffect of the adoption of this standard on our disclosures that will be included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 25, 2026.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included withineach income statement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this\nstandard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.\nNote 2 - Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense includes restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, market-based PSUs, and our employee stock\npurchase plan, or ESPP.\n9"}

Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 15.3% and 13.6% for the second quarter, and 14.9% and 13.7% for\nthe first half, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from foreign-derived deduction eligible income.\nOur effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits fromforeign-derived deduction eligible income, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal\nstatutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.\nIn July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was enacted into law and contains several changes to key U.S. federal income tax laws. As of July 27,2025, we have recognized the tax effects of certain OBBBA provisions, which did not have a material impact on our second quarter.\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in thenear term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could\nvary based on our assessment of all available information.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the positionwill be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal,\nstate and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwiseresolved with the respective tax authorities.\n11"}

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of thegaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, anddigital twin applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nRevenue growth in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated\ncomputing and AI solutions. Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the first half of the year, including our transition to Blackwell Ultra platforms.\nIn April 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that a license is required for exports of our H20 product into the China market. As a result of these newrequirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the\ndemand for H20 diminished. In August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, butto date, we have not generated any revenue or shipped any H20 products under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will\nreceive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. In the secondquarter, we recognized approximately $650 million of H20 revenue from sales to an unrestricted customer outside of China, resulting in a $180 million release ofpreviously reserved H20 inventory. There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.\nWe continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We began shippingproduction units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms including GB300 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated\nsystem configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased\n24"}

Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new\ntechnologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses. The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundationmodels is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly important across the ecosystem and it is dependent ondeveloper adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the\ninfluence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services. Future demand for our platform will depend on ourability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large language models—across our full stack of software and\nhardware offerings.\nThe availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of theseresources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.\nIn January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on our mostpopular data center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement\na replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on ourproducts or operations and/or add license requirements that could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe rapid evolution of global trade policies, such as new export controls and tariffs, has added complexity and increased costs throughout our supply chain, and\nthese challenges are likely to persist. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions byus and our partners, disrupt supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and\ndemand.\nWe plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected tostrengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing\ncapabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.\nMacroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and\ngeopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate andquantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of ourinvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously\nmanage product availability and costs with our vendors.\nRefer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSecond Quarter of Fiscal Year 2026 Summary\nThree Months Ended Quarter-over-QuarterChange Year-over-YearChange Jul 27, 2025 Apr 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nRevenue $ 46,743 $ 44,062 $ 30,040 6 % 56 %\nGross margin 72.4 % 60.5 % 75.1 % 11.9  pts (2.7) pts\nOperating expenses $ 5,413 $ 5,030 $ 3,932 8 % 38 %\nOperating income $ 28,440 $ 21,638 $ 18,642 31 % 53 %\nNet income $ 26,422 $ 18,775 $ 16,599 41 % 59 %\nNet income per diluted share $ 1.08 $ 0.76 $ 0.67 42 % 61 %\nWe benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestrictedcustomer outside of China.

Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test\nyield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-relatedintangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to\npersonnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margins decreased to 72.4% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 75.1% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, and 66.6% for thefirst half of fiscal year 2026 compared to 76.6% for the first half of fiscal year 2025, as our Blackwell revenue consists primarily of full-scale datacenter systems\ncompared to Hopper HGX systems last year. Gross margin for the first half of fiscal year 2026 was also impacted by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20excess inventory and purchase obligations.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $1.0 billion and $6.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026,respectively, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. Sales of previouslyreserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $501 million and $937 million for the second\nquarter and first half of fiscal year 2026, respectively. The second quarter of fiscal year 2026 included a provision release of $180 million upon the sale of H20products outside of the China market. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 1.1% and 5.9% in the second quarter and first half of\nfiscal year 2026, respectively.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $908 million and $1.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025,respectively, and were primarily due to low-yielding Blackwell material. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase\nobligations resulted in a provision release of $85 million and $199 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively. The net effect onour gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 2.0% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\n Three Months Ended Six Months Ended\n Jul 27, 2025Jul 28, 2024 $Change %Change Jul 27, 2025Jul 28, 2024 $Change %Change\n ($ in millions)\nResearch and developmentexpenses $ 4,291 $ 3,090 $ 1,201 39 % $ 8,280 $ 5,810 $ 2,470 43 %\nSales, general and administrativeexpenses 1,122 842 280 33 % 2,163 1,618 545 34 %\nTotal operating expenses$ 5,413 $ 3,932 $ 1,481 38 % $ 10,443 $ 7,428 $ 3,015 41 %\nThe increases in research and development expenses for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026 were primarily driven by a 68% and 69% increase\nin compute and infrastructure, 30% and 32% increase in compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth andcompensation increases, and a 68% and 116% increase in engineering development costs for new product introductions, respectively.\nThe increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026 were primarily driven by compensation and\nbenefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\n28"}

If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable topursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive,and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also\nimpose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions is harmed,future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Our investments in publicly traded and private companies could create volatility and fluctuationsin our results. These investments may generate realized and unrealized gains or losses and we could realize losses up to the value of the investments. In\naddition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives.These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the securities in which we invest are non-marketable and\nilliquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are notsuccessful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, anda decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses.\nWe face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’sattention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in\nobtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisitionor investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or areacquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n• difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key\npersonnel, of the acquired business;\n• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n• integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n• coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n• stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an\nacquisition;\n• potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or\nother restrictions;\n• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n• exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and\ncostly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processeswith our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel.

There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violateapplicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines,\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws,rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs,\nand/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliancecosts as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurityvulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European\nUnion, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from usregarding our business and competition in the graphics card and CSP market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also\nreceived, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom,China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments,partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies,\nroadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. Weexpect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests have been and are likely to be expensive and burdensome and could negativelyimpact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.\nGovernments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to developfrontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year\ntransitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have alreadyenacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of\nnew systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions tolaws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties\nor tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact thetiming of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negativelyimpact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import orexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or\nother trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an exportlicense with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or\nsanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties availableunder the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which\nblocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales toRussia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable ofenabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\n34"}

Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and usersworldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.\nAs geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export controlrestrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associatedproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and\napplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing andwarehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our\nbusiness, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasinglylikely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject tosimilar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and\nsemiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale,repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results.

The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for ourproducts, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to\nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impactingour business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls has and could in the future lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related\nsupply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of ourresearch and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to\nserve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provideour products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired aboutour sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. For example,\nregulators in China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. Ifregulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties,restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, restrictions or other orders regarding our networking business, products, and services, or otherwise impact our\noperations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOver the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, impacting our ability to serve customers outside\nthe United States.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor andsupercomputing industries. These restrictions impacted exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,\nproduce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed\nus of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries inthe Middle East.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D:1, D:4, and\nD:5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performancethresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S RTX 4090, GB200 NVL72, and B200. The licensing requirements also apply\nto the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,including China.\n35"}
{"doc_id": "nvidia-10q", "title": "nvidia-10q.pdf", "page": 36, "text": "On April 9, 2025, the USG informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companiesheadquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnectbandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with\nH20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 products diminished.\nThe export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance\ndensity” of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s datacenter market that receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/computemarket, with a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to controls targeting D:1, D:4 and D:5 countries, the USG has also imposed worldwide export controls impacting our products, and may imposeadditional controls in the future.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on ourdata center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. The AI Diffusion IFR would have divided the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier2” status, and would have created a complex and burdensome scheme for licensing approvals.\nIn May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of theforthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could\nhave a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long term, if thereare further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers\npurchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended serviceobligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if theUSG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose\nnot to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical supportefforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in\nChina, Europe, and Israel.\nIn August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, but to date, we have notgenerated any revenue or shipped any H20 products under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the\nrevenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. Any request for a percentage of therevenue by the USG may subject us to litigation, increase our costs, and harm our competitive position and benefit competitors that are not subject to such\narrangements.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any timeand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the\nevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensingrequirements.\nFor example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for exampleby imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip trackingand throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. Such\ngovernment mandates in chip designs could introduce system vulnerabilities and expose us to significant risk and potential liability, negatively impact demand forour products, and could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Even if not enacted into binding legislation, draft billshave impacted and may in the future negatively impact our business. For example, following U.S. legislative proposals calling for mandatory features in our\nchips, China’s government publicly questioned whether our H20 products have built-in vulnerabilities, discouraging customers from purchasing our products. Weprovided a public response explaining that our GPUs, including H20, do not include such built-in vulnerabilities, and will respond to any follow-up questions we\nreceive.\nOpen-source foundation models are rapidly growing in popularity with developers worldwide. Any regulatory control or other restriction that limits our ability toprovide products and services that support third-party applications and models,\n36"}
{"doc_id": "nvidia-10q", "title": "nvidia-10q.pdf", "page": 37, "text": "including applications built on foundation models originating in China such as DeepSeek or Qwen, could have a material impact on our business, operating\nresults, and financial condition.\nThe USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, itmay disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S.\nand Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete inmarkets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehousedin and distributed from Hong Kong.\nExport controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing ourGPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream\nparties to create large clusters for frontier model training.\nAny new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain ofour competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China\nand other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that theyare able to serve markets worldwide. Export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our\ncustomers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results.\nAs a result, export controls have in the past and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in othermarkets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because\nby the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale, resulting in excess inventory and purchaseobligations as we recently experienced with the H20. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely\nto be restricted by U.S. controls.\nThe increasingly complex export controls impose complex and burdensome compliance obligations on our partners, suppliers, and customers. While we seek tostrictly comply with all applicable export control regulators, reports of diversion of controlled products may negatively impact our business, relationships with\npartners and customers, and our reputation. Incorrect allegations that our compliance efforts satisfy the letter but not the “spirit” of the applicable regulations maynegatively impact our business, relationships with partners and customers, and our reputation.\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured inwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG adopted “Connected Vehicle” restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the UnitedStates, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. The USG is also\nconsidering restrictions that would limit our ability to support third-party applications and models built on open-source foundation models originating in China.Such restrictions, if implemented, would favor our foreign competitors and negatively impact our business.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming\nrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government has and may continueto encourage customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products\ncontaining components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of productscontaining certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan thatendorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in\nChina. If the Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet thenew standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business,\noperating results and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financialresults.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new\nrestrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact ourbusiness and financial results.\nItem 2.

Responsibility for Taxes.\n(a)    You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or an Affiliate takes with respect to any or all income tax,\nsocial insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally\napplicable to you or deemed by the Company or an Affiliate, in its discretion, to be an appropriate charge to you even if legally applicable to the\nCompany or an Affiliate (“Tax-Related Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed\nthe amount actually withheld by the Company or an Affiliate, if any.

In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any\nover-withheld amount in cash from the Company or an Affiliate (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you\nmay seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to\nthe applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or an Affiliate. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country, including\nyour share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority’s administrative practices, not to exceed the highest\nrate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax-Related\nItems is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full\nnumber of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock\nis held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.\n(d)    Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you\nany shares of Common Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award.\n(e)    In the event any obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of shares of Common Stock or it is determined\nafter the delivery of shares of Common Stock to you that the amount of the withholding obligation was greater than the amount withheld, if\nanything, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company and/or an Affiliate harmless from any failure by the Company and/or an Affiliate to\nwithhold the proper amount.\n11.
