Below is a summary of the principal risks associated with an investment in our securities.\n• Our sales depend on a small number of customers. A reduction in orders from any of these customers, the loss of any of these customers, or acustomer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• Consolidation in the markets we serve could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• If the optical communications market does not expand as we expect, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which could adverselyimpact our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• Our quarterly revenues, gross profit margins and operating results have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future, which maycause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline or be volatile.\n• If we are unable to continue diversifying our precision optical and electro-mechanical manufacturing services across other markets within theoptics industry, such as the semiconductor processing, biotechnology, metrology and material processing markets, or if these markets do not growas fast as we expect, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operatingresults.\n• We face significant competition in our business. If we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, our business,financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\n• Cancellations, delays or reductions of customer orders and the relatively short-term nature of the commitments of our customers could harm ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\n• Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• We purchase some of the critical materials used in certain of our products from a single source or a limited number of suppliers. Supply shortages\nhave in the past, and could in the future, impair the quality, reduce the availability or increase the cost of materials, which could harm our\nrevenues, profitability and customer relations.\n• Managing our inventory is complex and may require write-downs due to excess or obsolete inventory, which could cause our operating results todecrease significantly in a given fiscal period.\n• If we fail to adequately expand our manufacturing capacity, we will not be able to grow our business, which would harm our business, financialcondition and operating results. Conversely, if we expand too much or too rapidly, we may experience excess capacity, which would harm ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\n• We may experience manufacturing yields that are lower than expected, potentially resulting in increased costs, which could harm our business,operating results and customer relations.\n• If the products that we manufacture contain defects, we could incur significant correction costs, demand for our services may decline and we maybe exposed to product liability and product warranty claims, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and customerrelations.\n• If we fail to attract additional skilled employees or retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer.\n• Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in governmental policies regarding foreign currencies could increase our operatingcosts, which would adversely affect our operating results.\n• We conduct operations in a number of countries, which creates logistical and communications challenges for us and exposes us to other risks andchallenges that could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• We are subject to governmental export and import controls in several jurisdictions that subject us to a variety of risks, including liability,impairment of our ability to compete in international markets, and decreased sales and customer orders.\n• We are subject to risks related to changes in U.S. and international trade policies, including new or increased tariffs on materials that we use inmanufacturing, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n3"}
{"doc_id": "fabrinet_10q", "title": "fabrinet_10q.pdf", "page": 5, "text": "Table of Contents\n• Political unrest and demonstrations, as well as changes in the political, social, business or economic conditions in Thailand, could harm ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\n• We expect to continue to invest in our manufacturing operations in the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\"), which will continue to expose us torisks inherent in doing business in the PRC, any of which risks could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• Natural disasters, epidemics, acts of terrorism and political and economic developments could harm our business, financial condition andoperating results.\n• Unfavorable worldwide economic conditions (including inflation and supply chain disruptions) may negatively affect our business, financialcondition and operating results.\n• We may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our shareholders.\n• Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets.\n• We are not fully insured against all potential losses. Natural disasters or other catastrophes could adversely affect our business, financial conditionand operating results.\n• There are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordancewith U.S. GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand operating results.\n• Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure and/or cybersecurity attacks.\n• Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• Any failure to protect our customers’ intellectual property that we use in the products we manufacture for them could harm our customerrelationships and subject us to liability.\n• We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• We have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will berequired to continue to devote substantial resources to various compliance initiatives.\n• If we are unable to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for the products we manufacture, ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\n• Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andoperating results.\n• Our share price may be volatile due to fluctuations in our operating results and other factors, including the activities and operating results of ourcustomers or competitors, any of which could cause our share price to decline.\n• If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or if they publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, the market priceand trading volume of our ordinary shares could decline.\n• We may become a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences to U.S. investors.\n• Our business and share price could be negatively affected as a result of activist shareholders.\n• Certain provisions in our constitutional documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which could limit our shareholders'opportunity to sell shares at a premium.\n• Our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.\n• Certain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable.\n• Energy price volatility may negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\n4"}

The Company’s reported financial position\nor results of operations may be materially different under different conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions, particularly with\nrespect to significant accounting policies, which are discussed below. Significant assumptions are used in accounting for share-based compensation,\nthe fair value of warrant shares at grant date, allowance for expected credit losses, income taxes, and inventory obsolescence. Due to the inherent\nuncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates. In the event that the\nCompany's estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments will be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current\ninformation.\n10"}

Fair value of financial instruments\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is\nestablished, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs for the valuation of an\nasset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. If the\nassets or liabilities have a specified (contractual) term, Level 2 inputs must be observable for substantially the full term of assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities, which require the reporting entity to develop its own valuation techniques and\nassumptions.\nThe Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other\nrelevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\nThe following table provides details of the financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including:\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAs of March 28, 2025\nAssets\nCash equivalents $ — $ 48 $ — $ 48 \nCertificates of deposit and time deposits — 249,005 — 249,005 \nCorporate debt securities — 136,587 — 136,587 \nU.S. agency and U.S. treasury securities — 258,180 — 258,180 \nDerivative assets – current portion — 347 — 347 \nTotal $ — $ 644,167 $ — $ 644,167 \nLiabilities\n       Derivative liabilities – current portion $ — $ (1,129) $ — $ (1,129)\nTotal $ — $ (1,129) $ — $ (1,129)\n(1)\n(2)\n16"}

The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of its\nforeign currency denominated assets and liabilities and other foreign currency transactions. The Company enters into foreign currency forward and\noption contracts to hedge fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of forecasted transactions denominated in Thai baht and Canadian dollars with\ncounterparties that meet the Company’s minimum credit quality standard.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of up to 12 months to hedge fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of\nforecasted transactions denominated in Thai baht, including inventory purchases, payroll and other operating expenses. The Company considers these\nforward contracts as dual-purpose hedges, that hedge both the foreign exchange fluctuation (i) from inception through the forecasted expenditure, and\n(ii) any subsequent revaluation of the account payable or accrual. The Company may designate the forward contracts that hedge the foreign exchange\nfluctuation from inception through the forecasted expenditure as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualified\nas a cash flow hedging instrument is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or\nperiods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The reclassified amounts are presented in the same income statement line item\nas the earnings effect of the hedged item. Once the forecasted transactions are recorded, the Company will discontinue the hedging relationship by de-\ndesignating the derivative instrument and recording subsequent changes in fair value through contract maturity to foreign exchange gain (loss), net in\nthe unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as a natural hedge against the Thai baht denominated assets\nand liabilities.\nThe Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency forward and option contracts to provide an offset to the re-measurement of foreign\ncurrency denominated assets and liabilities and to hedge certain forecasted exposures. Changes in the fair value of these non-designated derivatives are\nrecorded as foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n(3)\n(4)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n17"}

{"doc_id": "fabrinet_10q", "title": "fabrinet_10q.pdf", "page": 30, "text": "Table of Contents\nOverview\nWe provide advanced optical packaging and precision optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing services to original equipment\nmanufacturers (“OEMs”) of complex products such as optical communication components, modules and sub-systems, industrial lasers, automotive\ncomponents, medical devices and sensors. We offer a broad range of advanced optical and electro-mechanical capabilities across the entire manufacturing\nprocess, including process design and engineering, supply chain management, manufacturing, complex printed circuit board assembly, advanced\npackaging, integration, final assembly and testing. We are capable of producing a wide variety of high complexity products in any mix and any volume.\nBased on our extensive experience and the positive feedback we have received from our customers, we believe we are a global leader in providing these\nservices to the optical communications, automotive, and industrial lasers markets.\nOur customer base includes companies in complex industries that require advanced precision manufacturing capabilities such as optical\ncommunications, automotive, industrial lasers, medical, and sensors. The products that we manufacture for our OEM customers include selective switching\nproducts; tunable lasers, transponders and transceivers; active optical cables; solid state, diode-pumped, gas and fiber lasers; and sensors. In many cases, we\nare the sole outsourced manufacturing partner used by our customers for the products that we manufacture for them.\nWe also design and fabricate application-specific crystals, lenses, prisms, mirrors, laser components, and substrates (collectively referred to as\n“customized optics”) and other custom and standard borosilicate, clear fused quartz, and synthetic fused silica glass products (collectively referred to as\n“customized glass”). We incorporate our customized optics and glass into many of the products we manufacture for our OEM customers, and we also sell\ncustomized optics and glass in the merchant market.\nRevenues\nWe believe we are able to expand our relationships with existing customers and attract new customers due to, among other factors, our broad range\nof complex engineering and manufacturing service offerings, flexible low-cost manufacturing platform, process optimization capabilities, advanced supply\nchain management, excellent customer service, and experienced management team. Although we expect the prices we charge for our manufactured\nproducts to decrease over time (partly as a result of competitive market forces), we believe we will be able to continue to maintain favorable pricing for our\nservices because of our ability to reduce cycle time, adjust our product mix by focusing on more complicated products, improve product quality and yields,\nand reduce material costs for the products we manufacture. We believe these capabilities have enabled us to help our OEM customers reduce their\nmanufacturing costs while maintaining or improving the design, quality, reliability, and delivery times for their products.\nRevenues by Geography\nWe generate revenues from three geographic regions: North America, Asia-Pacific and others, and Europe. Revenues are attributed to a particular\ngeographic area based on the bill-to location of our customers, notwithstanding that the products may be shipped to a different geographic region. The\nsubstantial majority of our revenues are derived from our manufacturing facilities in Asia-Pacific.\nThe percentage of our revenues generated from a bill-to location outside of North America decreased from 62.8% in the three months ended\nMarch 29, 2024 to 53.8% in the three months ended March 28, 2025, primarily because of an increase in revenue from a customer in the United States.\nThe percentage of our revenues generated from a bill-to location outside of North America decreased from 63.7% in the nine months ended\nMarch 29, 2024 to 56.8% in the nine months ended March 28, 2025, primarily because of an increase in revenue from a customer in the United States.\nBased on the short and medium-term indications and forecasts from our customers, we expect that the portion of our future revenues attributable to\ncustomers in regions outside North America for the remainder of fiscal year 2025 will be in line with the portion of revenues attributable to such customers\nduring the nine months ended March 28, 2025.\n29"}
{"doc_id": "fabrinet_10q", "title": "fabrinet_10q.pdf", "page": 31, "text": "Table of Contents\nThe following table presents percentages of total revenues by geographic region:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nMarch 28, 2025 March 29, 2024 March 28, 2025 March 29, 2024\nNorth America 46.2 % 37.2 % 43.2 % 36.3 %\nAsia-Pacific and others 45.9 57.0 49.0 57.2 \nEurope 7.9 5.8 7.8 6.5 \n100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nOur Contracts\nWe enter into supply agreements with our customers which generally have an initial term of up to three years, subject to automatic renewals for\nsubsequent one-year terms unless expressly terminated. Although there are no minimum purchase requirements in our supply agreements, our customers\nprovide us with rolling forecasts of their demand requirements. Our supply agreements generally include provisions for pricing and periodic review of\npricing, consignment of our customer’s unique production equipment to us, and the sharing of benefits from cost-savings derived from our efforts. We are\ngenerally required to purchase materials, which may include long lead-time materials and materials that are subject to minimum order quantities and/or\nnon-cancelable or non-returnable terms, to meet the stated demands of our customers. After procuring materials, we manufacture products for our\ncustomers based on purchase orders that contain terms regarding product quantities, delivery locations and delivery dates. Our customers generally are\nobligated to purchase finished goods that we have manufactured according to their demand requirements. Materials that are not consumed by our customers\nwithin a specified period of time, or that are no longer required due to a product’s cancellation or end-of-life, are typically designated as excess or obsolete\ninventory under our contracts. Once materials are designated as either excess or obsolete inventory, our customers are typically required to purchase such\ninventory from us even if they have chosen to cancel production of the related products. The excess or obsolete inventory is shipped to the customer and\nrecognized as an offset against cost of revenue upon shipment.\nCost of Revenues\nThe key components of our cost of revenues are material costs, employee costs, and infrastructure-related costs. Material costs generally represent\nthe majority of our cost of revenues. Several of the materials we require to manufacture products for our customers are customized for their products and\noften sourced from a single supplier or in some cases, our own subsidiaries. Shortages from sole-source suppliers due to yield loss, quality concerns and\ncapacity constraints, among other factors, may increase our expenses and negatively impact our gross profit margin or total revenues in a given quarter.\nMaterial costs include scrap material. Historically, scrap rate diminishes during a product’s life cycle due to process, fixturing and test improvement and\noptimization.\nA second significant element of our cost of revenues is employee costs, including indirect employee costs related to design, configuration and\noptimization of manufacturing processes for our customers, quality testing, materials testing and other engineering services, and direct costs related to our\nmanufacturing employees. Direct employee costs include employee salaries, insurance and benefits, merit-based bonuses, recruitment, training and\nretention. Historically, our employee costs have increased primarily due to increases in the number of employees necessary to support our growth and, to a\nlesser extent, costs to recruit, train and retain employees. Our cost of revenues is significantly impacted by salary levels in Thailand and the PRC, the\nfluctuation of the Thai baht, and Chinese Renminbi (\"RMB\") against our functional currency, the U.S. dollar, and our ability to retain our employees. We\nexpect our employee costs to increase as wages continue to increase in Thailand and the PRC. Wage increases may impact our ability to sustain our\ncompetitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin. We seek to mitigate these cost increases through improvements in employee productivity,\nemployee retention and asset utilization.\nOur infrastructure costs are comprised of depreciation, utilities, facilities management and overhead costs. Most of our facility leases are long-term\nagreements. Our depreciation costs include buildings and fixed assets, primarily at our Pinehurst and Chonburi campuses in Thailand, and capital\nequipment located at each of our manufacturing locations.\nWe expect to incur incremental costs of revenue as a result of our planned expansion into new geographic markets, though we are not able to\ndetermine the amount of these incremental expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses primarily consist of corporate employee costs for sales and marketing, general and administrative and other support personnel,\nincluding research and development expenses related to the design of customized optics and glass, travel expenses, legal and other professional fees, share-\nbased compensation expense and other general expenses not related to\n30"}

In fiscal year 2025, we expect our SG&A expenses will increase compared with our fiscal year 2024 SG&A expenses, mainly due to\nincreases in employee costs, legal expenses and research and development (\"R&D\") expenses.\nThe compensation committee of our board of directors approved a fiscal year 2025 executive incentive plan with quantitative objectives based solely\non achieving certain revenue targets and non-GAAP operating margin targets for fiscal year 2025. Bonuses under the fiscal year 2025 executive incentive\nplan are payable after the end of fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, the compensation committee approved a fiscal year 2024 executive incentive plan\nwith quantitative objectives that were based solely on achieving certain revenue targets and non-GAAP operating margin targets for fiscal year 2024.\nAdditional Financial Disclosures\nForeign Exchange\nAs a result of our international operations, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, and primarily with\nrespect to the Thai baht. Although a majority of our total revenues is denominated in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of our payroll plus certain other\noperating expenses are incurred and paid in Thai baht. The exchange rate between the Thai baht and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated substantially in recent\nyears and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. We report our financial results in U.S. dollars and our results of operations have been and\ncould in the future be negatively impacted if the Thai baht appreciates against the U.S. dollar. Smaller portions of our expenses are incurred in a variety of\nother currencies, including RMB, GBP, Canadian dollars, Euros, and Japanese yen, the appreciation of which may also negatively impact our financial\nresults.\nIn order to manage the risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we use derivative instruments. We may enter into foreign\ncurrency exchange forward or put option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities and other forecasted\nforeign currency transactions and may designate these instruments as hedging instruments. The forward and put option contracts generally have maturities\nof up to 12 months. All foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Gains or\nlosses on our forward and put option contracts generally present gross amount in the assets, liabilities, and transactions economically hedged.\nWe had foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities in Thai baht, RMB and GBP as follows:\nAs of March 28, 2025 As of June 28, 2024\n(in thousands, except percentages) Foreign Currency $ %\nForeign Currency $ %\nAssets\nThai baht 1,145,359 33,796 80.9 % 1,046,000 28,385 72.5 %\nRMB 35,054 4,885 11.7 42,852 6,013 15.4 \nGBP 2,400 3,106 7.4 3,778 4,773 12.1 \nTotal $ 41,787 100.0 % $ 39,171 100.0 %\nLiabilities\nThai baht 4,087,353 120,606 91.5 % 3,263,391 88,559 87.4 %\nRMB 79,458 11,074 8.4 78,418 11,003 10.9 \nGBP 111 144 0.1 1,359 1,717 1.7 \nTotal $ 131,824 100.0 % $ 101,279 100.0 %\nThe Thai baht assets represent cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, deposits and other current assets. The Thai baht liabilities\nrepresent trade accounts payable, accrued expenses, income tax payable, accrued employee benefits and other payables. We manage our exposure to\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates by the use of foreign currency contracts and offsetting assets and liabilities denominated in the same currency in\naccordance with management’s policy. As of March 28, 2025, there was $155.0 million of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding on the Thai baht\npayables. As of June 28, 2024, there was $135.0 million of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding on the Thai baht payables.\nThe RMB assets represent cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other receivables, and other current assets. The RMB liabilities\nrepresent trade accounts payable, accrued expenses, income tax payable, accrued payroll, bonus and related expenses, and other payables. As of March 28,\n2025 and June 28, 2024, we did not have any derivative contracts denominated in RMB.\n31"}

The GBP liabilities represent trade accounts payable, accrued\nexpenses, and other payables. As of March 28, 2025 and June 28, 2024, we did not have any derivative contracts denominated in GBP.\nFor the three months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, we recorded unrealized gain of $1.6 million and unrealized loss of $3.7 million,\nrespectively, related to derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income.\nFor the nine months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, we recorded unrealized gain of $0.6 million and unrealized loss $0.8 million,\nrespectively, related to derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income.\nCurrency Regulation and Dividend Distribution\nForeign exchange regulation in the PRC is primarily governed by the following rules:\n• Foreign Currency Administration Rules, as amended on August 5, 2008, or the Exchange Rules;\n• Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration Rules; and\n• Notice on Perfecting Practices Concerning Foreign Exchange Settlement Regarding the Capital Contribution by Foreign-invested Enterprises,\nas promulgated by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), on August 29, 2008, or Circular 142.\nUnder the Exchange Rules, RMB is freely convertible into foreign currencies for current account items, including the distribution of dividends,\ninterest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. However, conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct\ninvestments, loans, security investments and repatriation of investments, is still subject to the approval of SAFE.\nUnder the Administration Rules, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell, or remit foreign currencies at banks authorized to conduct foreign\nexchange business after providing valid commercial documents and relevant supporting documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions,\nobtaining approval from SAFE. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of the PRC are also subject to limitations, which include\napprovals by the Ministry of Commerce, SAFE and the State Development and Reform Commission. \nCircular 142 regulates the conversion by a foreign-invested company of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be\nused. Circular 142 requires that the registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies may only be used\nfor purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In\naddition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises settled in RMB converted from\nforeign currencies. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval and may not be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of\nsuch loans have not been used.\nOn January 5, 2007, SAFE promulgated the Detailed Rules for Implementing the Measures for the Administration on Individual Foreign Exchange,or the Implementation Rules. Under the Implementation Rules, PRC citizens who are granted share options by an overseas publicly-listed company arerequired, through a PRC agent or PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly-listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures.\nIn addition, the General Administration of Taxation has issued circulars concerning employee share options. Under these circulars, our employees\nworking in the PRC who exercise share options will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Our PRC subsidiary has obligations to file documents related\nto employee share options with relevant tax authorities and withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options.\nFurthermore, our transfer of funds to our subsidiaries in Thailand and the PRC are each subject to approval by governmental authorities in case of an\nincrease in registered capital, or subject to registration with governmental authorities in case of a shareholder loan. These limitations on the flow of funds\nbetween our subsidiaries and us could restrict our ability to act in response to changing market conditions.\n32"}

We are domiciled in the Cayman\nIslands. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to tax in the Cayman Islands on income or capital gains until March 6, 2039.\nThroughout the period of our operations in Thailand, we have generally received income tax and other incentives from the Thailand Board of\nInvestment. Preferential tax treatment from the Thai government in the form of a corporate tax exemption on income generated from projects to\nmanufacture certain products at our Chonburi campus is currently available to us through June 2026. Similar preferential tax treatment was available to us\nthrough June 2020 with respect to products manufactured at our Pinehurst campus Building 6. After June 2020, 50% of our income generated from\nproducts manufactured at our Pinehurst campus will be exempted from tax through June 2025. Preferential tax treatment is available to us for products\nmanufactured at our Chonburi campus Building 9, where income generated will be tax exempt through 2031, capped at our actual investment amount. Such\npreferential tax treatment is contingent on various factors, including the export of our customers’ products out of Thailand and our agreement not to move\nour manufacturing facilities out of our current province in Thailand for at least 15 years from the date on which preferential tax treatment was granted.\nCurrently, the corporate income tax rate for our Thai subsidiary is 20%.\nAs of March 28, 2025, the corporate income tax rates for our subsidiaries in the PRC, the U.S., the U.K. and Israel are 25%, 21%, 25% and 23%,\nrespectively.\nOur deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that\nwill result in deductible and payable amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards. Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net\ndeferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to\nrealize these deferred income tax assets. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change depending on future market conditions, changes in U.S.\nor international tax laws, or other factors. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our\nvaluation allowance against the deferred tax assets, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nWe prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these\nestimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and on various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets\nand liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process,\nactual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We\nconsider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as their application\nplaces the most significant demands on our management’s judgment.\nOur critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2024. The adoption of new\naccounting policies and accounting standards are disclosed in Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no changes\nto our accounting policies.\n33"}

As of March 29, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of\n$794.0 million and outstanding debt of $3.0 million.\nOur cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of cash on hand, demand deposits, and liquid investments with original maturities of three\nmonths or less, are placed with banks and other financial institutions. The weighted-average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents was 4.1% and\n4.3% for the three and nine months ended March 28, 2025, respectively, and 4.5% and 4.3% for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2024,\nrespectively.\nOur cash investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the audit committee of our board of directors. In general, our\ninvestment policy requires that securities purchased be rated A1, P-1, F1 or better. No security may have an effective maturity that exceeds three years. Our\ninvestments in fixed income securities are primarily classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the\nspecific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) and are reported as a\nseparate component of shareholders’ equity.\nAs of March 29, 2024, we had long-term borrowing under our credit facility agreement of $3.0 million. As of March 28, 2025, we had no\noutstanding balance under our credit facility agreement. To better manage our cash on hand, we held short-term investments of $643.8 million as of\nMarch 28, 2025.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flow from operations, and funds available through our credit\nfacility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to sustain our working\ncapital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We also believe that our current\nmanufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our anticipated production requirements for at least the next few quarters. In February 2025, we began\nconstruction of a new manufacturing facility of approximately 2.0 million square feet at our Chonburi campus. The total expected cost of the project is\napproximately $132.5 million (Thai baht 4.45 billion).\nThe following table shows our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands) March 28, 2025 March 29, 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 273,272 $ 330,084 \nNet cash used in investing activities $ (253,126) $ (118,615)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (124,393) $ (57,800)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (104,247) $ 153,669 \nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. The decrease in\ncash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended March 28, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended March 29, 2024 was primarily\ndue to (1) a change in inventories of $133.6 million due to new products and higher sales volume, and (2) a decrease in other payables of $17.2 million,\noffset by (1) a change in other current and non-current assets of $31.2 million, (2) an increase in trade payables of $30.9 million, and (3) an increase in net\nincome of $30.2 million.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting cash flows consist primarily of investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and capital expenditures. The increase in cash used\nin investing activities for the nine months ended March 28, 2025 as compared to cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended March 29, 2024\nwas primarily due to an increase in investment purchases, and an increase in capital expenditures to support certain customers.\n38"}

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $950.7 million and $858.6 million as of March 28, 2025 and June 28, 2024,\nrespectively. We have interest rate risk exposure relating to the interest income generated by excess cash invested in highly liquid investments with\nmaturities of three months or less from the original dates of purchase. The cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held for working capital\npurposes. We have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to\nmaterial risks due to changes in market interest rates. Declines in interest rates, however, will reduce future investment income. If overall interest rates had\ndeclined by 10 basis points during the nine months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, our interest income would have decreased by\napproximately $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, assuming consistent investment levels.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio in a variety of financial instruments, including, but not limited to, U.S. government and agency bonds,\ncorporate obligations, money market funds, asset-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities. The majority of these investments pay a fixed\nrate of interest. The securities in the investment portfolio are subject to market price risk due to changes in interest rates, perceived issuer creditworthiness,\nmarketability, and other factors. These investments are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our unaudited\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity.\nInvestments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market values of our fixed-\nrate securities decline if interest rates rise, while floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these\nfactors, our future investment income may be less than we expect because of changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell\nsecurities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAs a result of our foreign operations, we have significant expenses, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. Substantially all\nof our employees and most of our facilities are located in Thailand and the PRC. Therefore, a substantial portion of our payroll as well as certain other\noperating expenses are paid in Thai baht and RMB. The significant majority of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars because our customer\ncontracts generally provide that our customers will pay us in U.S. dollars.\nAs a consequence, our gross profit margins, operating results, profitability and cash flows are adversely impacted when the dollar depreciates\nrelative to the Thai baht or the RMB. We have a particularly significant currency rate exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the Thai baht, the\nRMB and the U.S. dollar. We must translate foreign currency-denominated results of operations, assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to U.S.\ndollars in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with\nsuch foreign currencies will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our unaudited condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets, even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency. These transactions could\nsignificantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities\nand shareholders’ equity.\nWe attempt to hedge against these exchange rate risks by entering into derivative instruments that are typically one to eighteen months in duration,\nleaving us exposed to longer term changes in exchange rates. Beginning December 28, 2019, we designated the foreign currency forward contracts used to\nhedge fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of forecasted transactions denominated in Thai baht as cash flow hedges, as they qualified for hedge accounting\nbecause the hedges are highly effective. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify as highly\neffective, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in our earnings. Any gains or losses related to these outstanding\nforeign currency forward contracts will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance\nsheets, with subsequent reclassification to the same statement of operations and comprehensive income line item as the earnings effect of hedge items when\nsettled. We recorded an unrealized gain of $0.6 million and unrealized loss of $0.8 million for the nine months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024,\nrespectively, related to derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate relative to the U.S. dollar,\nwe expect to incur foreign currency translation adjustments and may incur foreign currency exchange losses. For example, a 10% weakening in the U.S.\ndollar against the Thai baht and the RMB would have resulted in a decrease in our net dollar position of approximately $10.0 million and $7.2 million as of\nMarch 28, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. We cannot give any assurance as to the effect that future changes in foreign currency rates will have on\nour unaudited condensed consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows.\n40"}

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn June 28, 2024, Ngan In Leng and First Laser Limited (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint in the Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court\n(the “Court”) in Fuzhou, China against Fujian Enterprises (Holdings) Co., Ltd. (“FEHC”), Jian An Investment Limited (“Jian”), and Casix, Inc. (“Casix”),\nour wholly-owned subsidiary located in the PRC. The complaint alleges unjust enrichment related to a purported investment in Casix by the Plaintiffs in\n1997, which predates our acquisition of Casix from JDS Uniphase Corporation. The Plaintiffs have requested that the Court order FEHC to return the\nunjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs in the amount of RMB 400 million, with interest from March 1, 2000, and order Jian and Casix to bear joint and several\nliability for all payment obligations of FEHC.\nIn September 2024, the Court dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety based on jurisdictional grounds. The Plaintiffs have since appealed the Court’s\nruling to the High People's Court of Fujian Province (the \"Appellate Court\"). In their appeal, the Plaintiffs now claim that Casix is the primary obligor to\nreturn the alleged unjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs. On November 24, 2024, the Appellate Court agreed to hear the appeal. At this time, we are not able to\nquantify any potential liability in connection with this litigation because of the early stage of this litigation.\nIn addition, we are from time to time subject to, and are presently involved in, litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matter described\nabove, there are no pending lawsuits or claims that, individually or in the aggregate, may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or\noperating results. Our views and estimates related to these matters may change in the future, as new events and circumstances arise and as the matters\ncontinue to develop.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information\ncontained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before\ninvesting in our ordinary shares. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties of\nwhich we are unaware, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us or our ordinary shares. If any of the\nfollowing risks actually occur, they may harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In this event, the market price of our ordinary shares\ncould decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nCompany and Operational Risks\nOur sales depend on a small number of customers. A reduction in orders from any of these customers, the loss of any of these customers, or a\ncustomer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have depended, and will continue to depend, upon a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues. During the three\nmonths ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, we had three customers and two customers, respectively, that each contributed 10% or more of our\nrevenues. Such customers together accounted for 52.2% and 52.5% of our revenues during the respective periods. During the nine months ended March 28,\n2025 and March 29, 2024, we had two customers and three customers, respectively, that each contributed 10% or more of our revenues. Such customers\ntogether accounted for 47.5% and 56.4% of our revenues during the respective periods. Dependence on a small number of customers means that a reduction\nin orders from, a loss of, or other adverse actions by any one of these customers would reduce our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, our customer concentration increases the concentration of our accounts receivable and our exposure to payment default by any of our key\ncustomers. Many of our existing and potential customers have substantial debt burdens, have experienced financial distress or have static or declining\nrevenues, all of which may be exacerbated by the current global economic downturn and subsequent adverse conditions in the credit markets, as well as the\nimpact of changes to U.S. and international trade policies. Certain of our customers have gone out of business, declared bankruptcy, been acquired, or\nannounced their withdrawal from segments of the optics market. We generate significant accounts payable and inventory for the services that we provide to\nour customers, which could expose us to substantial and potentially unrecoverable costs if we do not receive payment from our customers.\nOur reliance on a small number of customers gives our customers substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contracts with us. In\naddition, although we enter into master supply agreements with our customers, the level of business to be transacted under those agreements is not\nguaranteed. Instead, we are awarded business under those agreements\n42"}

Some of our customers have at times significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services that they order\nfrom us. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our existing significant customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could\nbe harmed.\nConsolidation in the markets we serve could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nConsolidation in the markets we serve has resulted in a reduction in the number of potential customers for our services.

(formerly known as II-VI Incorporated) completed its acquisition of Coherent, Inc. in July 2022; and Cisco\nSystems, Inc. completed its acquisition of Acacia Communications, Inc. in March 2021. In some cases, consolidation among our customers has led to a\nreduction in demand for our services as customers have acquired the capacity to manufacture products in-house.\nConsolidation among our customers and their customers will continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results in\nseveral ways. Consolidation among our customers and their customers may result in a smaller number of large customers whose size and purchasing power\ngive them increased leverage that may result in, among other things, decreases in our average selling prices. In addition to pricing pressures, this\nconsolidation may also reduce overall demand for our manufacturing services if customers obtain new capacity to manufacture products in-house or\ndiscontinue duplicate or competing product lines in order to streamline operations. If demand for our manufacturing services decreases, our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nIf the optical communications market does not expand as we expect, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which could adversely\nimpact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRevenues from optical communications products represented 75.4% and 80.9% of our revenues for the three months ended March 28, 2025 and\nMarch 29, 2024, respectively. Our future success as a provider of precision optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing services for the optical\ncommunications market depends on the continued growth of the optics industry and, in particular, the continued expansion of global information networks,\nparticularly those directly or indirectly dependent upon a fiber optic infrastructure. As part of that growth, we anticipate that demand for voice, video, and\nother data services delivered over high-speed connections (both wired and wireless) will continue to increase. Without network and bandwidth growth, the\nneed for enhanced communications products would be jeopardized. Currently, demand for network services and for high-speed broadband access, in\nparticular, is increasing but growth may be limited by several factors, including, among others: (1) relative strength or weakness of the global economy or\nthe economy in certain countries or regions, (2) an uncertain regulatory environment, and (3) uncertainty regarding long-term sustainable business models\nas multiple industries, such as the cable, traditional telecommunications, wireless and satellite industries, offer competing content delivery solutions. The\noptical communications market also has experienced periods of overcapacity, some of which have occurred even during periods of relatively high network\nusage and bandwidth demands. If the factors described above were to slow, stop or reverse the expansion in the optical communications market, our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results would be negatively affected.\nOur quarterly revenues, gross profit margins and operating results have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future, which\nmay cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline or be volatile.\nOur quarterly revenues, gross profit margins, and operating results have fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the\nfuture. For example, any of the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and, in particular, the following factors, could cause our revenues, gross profit\nmargins, and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter:\n• any reduction in customer demand or our ability to fulfill customer orders as a result of disruptions in our supply chain;\n• our ability to acquire new customers and retain our existing customers;\n• the cyclicality of the optical communications, automotive, industrial lasers, medical and sensors markets;\n• competition;\n• our ability to achieve favorable pricing for our services;\n• the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n• our ability to manage our headcount and other costs; and\n• changes in the relative mix in our revenues.\n43"}

You\nshould not rely on our results for one quarter as any indication of our future performance. Quarterly variations in our operations could result in significant\nvolatility in the market price of our ordinary shares.\nIf we are unable to continue diversifying our precision optical and electro-mechanical manufacturing services across other markets within the\noptics industry, such as the semiconductor processing, biotechnology, metrology and material processing markets, or if these markets do not grow as\nfast as we expect, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe intend to continue diversifying across other markets within the optics industry, such as the semiconductor processing, biotechnology, metrology,\nand material processing markets, to reduce our dependence on the optical communications market and to grow our business. Currently, the optical\ncommunications market contributes the significant majority of our revenues. There can be no assurance that our efforts to further expand and diversify into\nother markets within the optics industry will prove successful or that these markets will continue to grow as fast as we expect. If the opportunities presented\nby these markets prove to be less than anticipated, if we are less successful than expected in diversifying into these markets, or if our margins in these\nmarkets prove to be less than expected, our growth may slow or stall, and we may incur costs that are not offset by revenues in these markets, all of which\ncould harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face significant competition in our business. If we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nOur current and prospective customers tend to evaluate our capabilities against the merits of their internal manufacturing as well as the capabilities\nof other third-party manufacturers. We believe the internal manufacturing capabilities of current and prospective customers are our primary competition.\nThis competition is particularly strong when our customers have excess manufacturing capacity, as was the case when the markets that we serve\nexperienced a significant downturn in 2008 and 2009 that resulted in underutilized capacity. Should our existing and potential customers have excess\nmanufacturing capacity at their facilities, it could adversely affect our business. In addition, as a result of the 2011 flooding in Thailand, some of our\ncustomers began manufacturing products internally or using other third-party manufacturers that were not affected by the flooding. If our customers choose\nto manufacture products internally rather than to outsource production to us, or choose to outsource to a different third-party manufacturer, our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nCompetitors in the market for optical manufacturing services include Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Celestica Inc., Sanmina-SCI Corporation, Jabil\nCircuit, Inc., Venture Corporation Limited, and InnoLight Technology (Suzhou) Ltd. Our customized optics and glass operations face competition from\ncompanies such as Fujian Castech Crystals, Inc., Photop Technologies, Inc., and Research Electro-Optic, Inc. Other existing contract manufacturing\ncompanies, original design manufacturers or outsourced semiconductor assembly and test companies could also enter our target markets. In addition, we\nmay face new competitors as we attempt to penetrate new markets.\nMany of our customers and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly\ngreater resources than we have. These advantages may allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of service\nofferings that are similar or superior to our service offerings. These competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development, undertake\nmore far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or offer services that achieve greater market acceptance than ours. These\ncompetitors may also compete with us by making more attractive offers to our existing and potential employees, suppliers, and strategic partners. Further,\nconsolidation in the optics industry could lead to larger and more geographically diverse competitors. New and increased competition could result in price\nreductions for our services, reduced gross profit margins or loss of market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future\ncompetitors, and the competitive pressures we face may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n44"}

While we work closely with our\ncustomers to develop forecasts for periods of up to one year, these forecasts are not binding and may be unreliable. Customers may cancel their orders,\nchange production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production for a number of reasons beyond our control. Any material delay, cancellation or\nreduction of orders could cause our revenues to decline significantly and could cause us to hold excess materials. Many of our costs and operating expenses\nare fixed. As a result, a reduction in customer demand could decrease our gross profit and harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we make significant decisions with respect to production schedules, material procurement commitments, personnel needs and other\nresource requirements based on our estimate of our customers’ requirements. The short-term nature of our customers’ commitments and the possibility of\nrapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers. Inability to forecast the level\nof customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to allocate resources to specific customers, order appropriate levels of materials and maximize the use\nof our manufacturing capacity. This could also lead to an inability to meet a spike in production demand, all of which could harm our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nOur exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSome of our customers and suppliers have in the past and may in the future experience financial difficulty, particularly in light of adverse conditions\nin the credit markets that have affected access to capital and liquidity. During challenging economic times, our customers may face difficulties in gaining\ntimely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us. As a result, we devote significant resources to monitor\nreceivables and inventory balances with certain of our customers. If our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering\namounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our services from these customers could decline. If our suppliers experience financial difficulty,\nwe could have trouble sourcing materials necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments. Any such financial difficulty could\nadversely affect our operating results and financial condition by resulting in a reduction in our revenues, a charge for inventory write-offs, a provision for\nexpected credit losses, and larger working capital requirements due to increased days in inventory and days in accounts receivable.\nWe purchase some of the critical materials used in certain of our products from a single source or a limited number of suppliers. Supply\nshortages have in the past, and could in the future, impair the quality, reduce the availability or increase the cost of materials, which could harm our\nrevenues, profitability and customer relations.\nWe rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers for critical materials used in a significant number of the products we manufacture. We\ngenerally purchase these single or limited source materials through standard purchase orders and do not maintain long-term supply agreements with our\nsuppliers. We generally use a rolling 12-month forecast based on anticipated product orders, customer forecasts, product order history, backlog, and\nwarranty and service demand to determine our materials requirements. Lead times for the parts and components that we order vary significantly and depend\non factors such as manufacturing cycle times, manufacturing yields, and the availability of raw materials used to produce the parts or components.\nHistorically, we have experienced supply shortages resulting from various causes, including reduced yields by our suppliers, which prevented us from\nmanufacturing products for our customers in a timely manner. The semiconductor supply chain is complex, and, in recent years, there has been a significant\nglobal shortage of semiconductors. Demand for consumer electronics surged during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains strong, which in turn has\nincreased the demand for semiconductors. At the same time, wafer foundries that support chipmakers have not invested enough in recent years to increase\ncapacities to the levels needed to support the increased demand from all of their customers. Further exacerbating the shortage is the long production lead-\ntime for wafers, which can be as long as 30 weeks in some cases. A shortage of semiconductors or other key components can cause a significant disruption\nto our production schedule and have a substantial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur revenues, profitability and customer relations will be harmed by continued fluctuations in the availability of materials, a stoppage or delay of\nsupply, a substitution of more expensive or less reliable parts, the receipt of defective parts or contaminated materials, an increase in the price of supplies,\nor an inability to obtain reductions in price from our suppliers in response to competitive pressures. We continue to undertake programs to strengthen our\nsupply chain. Nevertheless, we are experiencing, and expect for the foreseeable future to experience, strain on our supply chain, as well as periodic supplier\n45"}

These supply chain issues have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we have incurred, and expect\nfor the foreseeable future to incur, increased costs related to our efforts to address these problems.\nManaging our inventory is complex and may require write-downs due to excess or obsolete inventory, which could cause our operating results to\ndecrease significantly in a given fiscal period.\nManaging our inventory is complex. We are generally required to procure materials based upon the anticipated demand of our customers. The\ninaccuracy of these forecasts or estimates could result in excess supply or shortages of certain materials. Inventory that is not used or expected to be used as\nand when planned may become excess or obsolete. Generally, we are unable to use most of the materials purchased for one of our customers to\nmanufacture products for any of our other customers. Additionally, we could experience reduced or delayed product shipments or incur additional\ninventory write-downs and cancellation charges or penalties, which would increase costs and could harm our business, financial condition and operating\nresults. While our agreements with customers are structured to mitigate our risks related to excess or obsolete inventory, enforcement of these provisions\nmay result in material expense, and delay in payment for inventory. If any of our significant customers becomes unable or unwilling to purchase inventory\nor does not agree to such contractual provisions in the future, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nIf we fail to adequately expand our manufacturing capacity, we will not be able to grow our business, which would harm our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. Conversely, if we expand too much or too rapidly, we may experience excess capacity, which would harm our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to pursue many large customer orders or sustain our historical growth rates if we do not have sufficient manufacturing capacity\nto enable us to commit to provide customers with specified quantities of products. If our customers do not believe that we have sufficient manufacturing\ncapacity, they may: (1) outsource all of their production to another manufacturer that they believe can fulfill all of their production requirements; (2) look to\na second manufacturer for the manufacture of additional quantities of the products that we currently manufacture for them; (3) manufacture the products\nthemselves; or (4) decide against using our services for their new products.\nWe most recently expanded our manufacturing capacity by building a new facility at our Chonburi campus in Thailand in 2022, and we began\nconstruction of a new manufacturing building at our Chonburi campus in February 2025. We may continue to devote significant resources to the expansion\nof our manufacturing capacity, and any such expansion will be expensive, will require management’s time and may disrupt our operations. In the event we\nare unsuccessful in our attempts to expand our manufacturing capacity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nHowever, if we successfully expand our manufacturing capacity but are unable to promptly utilize the additional space due to reduced demand for\nour services or an inability to win new projects, add new customers or penetrate new markets, or if the optics industry does not grow as we expect, we may\nexperience periods of excess capacity, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may experience manufacturing yields that are lower than expected, potentially resulting in increased costs, which could harm our business,\noperating results and customer relations.\nManufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n• the quality of input, materials and equipment;\n• the quality and feasibility of our customer’s design;\n• the repeatability and complexity of the manufacturing process;\n• the experience and quality of training of our manufacturing and engineering teams; and\n• the monitoring of the manufacturing environment.\nLower volume production due to continually changing designs generally results in lower yields. Manufacturing yields and margins can also be lower\nif we receive or inadvertently use defective or contaminated materials from our suppliers. In addition, our customer contracts typically provide that we will\nsupply products at a fixed price each quarter, which assumes specific production yields and quality metrics. If we do not meet the yield assumptions and\nquality metrics used in calculating the price of a product, we may not be able to recover the costs associated with our failure to do so. Consequently, our\noperating results and profitability may be harmed.\n46"}

In addition, our customers’ products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them are often complex. As a result,\nproducts that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or fail to be\nin compliance with applicable statutory or regulatory requirements. Additionally, not all defects are immediately detectable. The testing procedures of our\ncustomers are generally limited to the evaluation of the products that we manufacture under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons\n(including, among others, the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable at the time of testing or that are detected only when products are\nfully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions), these products may fail to perform as expected after their initial acceptance by a customer.\nWe generally provide a warranty of between one to five years on the products that we manufacture for our customers. This warranty typically\nguarantees that products will conform to our customers’ specifications and be free from defects in workmanship. Defects in the products we manufacture,\nwhether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or by deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, and whether such defects\nare discovered during or after the warranty period, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation, whether or\nnot we are indemnified for such failures. We could also incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when\nsuch failures occur in installed systems. In some instances, we may also be required to incur costs to repair or replace defective products outside of the\nwarranty period in the event that a recurring defect is discovered in a certain percentage of a customer’s products delivered over an agreed upon period of\ntime. We have experienced product or component failures in the past and remain exposed to such failures, as the products that we manufacture are widely\ndeployed throughout the world in multiple environments and applications. Further, due to the difficulty in determining whether a given defect resulted from\nour customer’s design of the product or our manufacturing process, we may be exposed to product liability or product warranty claims arising from defects\nthat are not attributable to our manufacturing process. In addition, if the number or type of defects exceeds certain percentage limitations contained in our\ncontractual arrangements, we may be required to conduct extensive failure analysis, re-qualify for production or cease production of the specified products.\nProduct liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage. Product warranty claims may include liability for a recall,\nrepair or replacement of a product or component. Although liability for these claims is generally assigned to our customers in our contracts, even where\nthey have assumed liability our customers may not, or may not have the resources to, satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product.\nAdditionally, under one of our contracts, in the event the products we manufacture do not meet the end-customer’s testing requirements or otherwise fail,\nwe may be required to pay penalties to our customer, including a fee during the time period that the customer or end-customer’s production line is not\noperational as a result of the failure of the products that we manufacture, all of which could harm our business, operating results and customer relations. If\nwe engineer or manufacture a product that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could incur\nsignificant costs to resolve the claim. While we maintain insurance for certain product liability claims, we do not maintain insurance for any recalls and,\ntherefore, would be required to pay any associated costs that are determined to be our responsibility. A successful product liability or product warranty\nclaim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited, is not available or has not been obtained\ncould harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to attract additional skilled employees or retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract additional skilled employees and retain our current key personnel. We have identified\nseveral areas where we intend to expand our hiring, including business development, finance, human resources, operations and supply chain management.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Our future also\ndepends on the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key management and technical personnel, each of whom would be\ndifficult to replace. Although we have key person life insurance policies on some of our executive officers, the loss of any of our executive officers or key\npersonnel or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n47"}

The primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on our cash, receivables, and payables of our operating entities. We may\nexperience significant unexpected losses from fluctuations in exchange rates. For example, in the three months ended September 27, 2024, we experienced\na $7.1 million foreign exchange loss, which negatively affected our net income per share for the same period by $0.19.\nOur customer contracts generally require that our customers pay us in U.S. dollars. However, the majority of our payroll and other operating\nexpenses are paid in Thai baht. As a result of these arrangements, we have significant exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the Thai baht and\nthe U.S. dollar, and our operating results are adversely impacted when the U.S. dollar depreciates relative to the Thai baht and other currencies. As of\nMarch 28, 2025, the U.S. dollar had depreciated approximately 0.6% against the Thai baht since March 31, 2023. While we attempt to hedge against\ncertain exchange rate risks, we typically enter into hedging contracts with maturities of up to 12 months, leaving us exposed to longer term changes in\nexchange rates.\nAdditionally, we have significant exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) and the U.S. dollar. The\nexpenses of our subsidiaries located in the PRC are denominated in RMB. Currently, RMB are convertible in connection with trade and service-related\nforeign exchange transactions, foreign debt service, and payment of dividends. The PRC government may at its discretion restrict access in the future to\nforeign currencies for current account transactions. If this occurs, our PRC subsidiary may not be able to pay us dividends in U.S. dollars without prior\napproval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange. In addition, conversion of RMB for most capital account items, including direct\ninvestments, is still subject to government approval in the PRC. This restriction may limit our ability to invest the earnings of our PRC subsidiary. As of\nMarch 28, 2025, the U.S. dollar had appreciated approximately 6.1% against the RMB since March 31, 2023. There remains significant international\npressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantially more liberalized currency policy. Any appreciation in the value of the RMB against the U.S.\ndollar could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe conduct operations in a number of countries, which creates logistical and communications challenges for us and exposes us to other risks\nand challenges that could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe vast majority of our operations, including manufacturing and customer support, are located primarily in the Asia- Pacific region. The distances\nbetween Thailand, the PRC and our customers and suppliers globally create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us, including\nmanaging operations across multiple time zones, directing the manufacture and delivery of products across significant distances, coordinating the\nprocurement of raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations and coordinating the activities and decisions of our management team, the members\nof which are based in different countries.\nOur customers are located throughout the world, and our principal manufacturing facilities are located in Thailand. Revenues from the bill-to-\nlocation of customers outside of North America accounted for 53.8% and 62.8% of our revenues for the three months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29,\n2024, respectively. We expect that revenues from the bill-to-location of customers outside of North America will continue to account for a significant\nportion of our revenues. Our customers also depend on international sales, which further exposes us to the risks associated with international operations.\nConducting business outside the United States subjects us to a number of risks and challenges, including:\n• compliance with a variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including trade regulatory requirements;\n• periodic changes in a specific country or region’s economic conditions, such as recession;\n• unanticipated restrictions on our ability to sell to foreign customers where sales of products and the provision of services may require export\nlicenses or are prohibited by government action (for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has prohibited the export and sale of a broad\ncategory of U.S. products, as well as the provision of services, to ZTE Corporation and to Huawei, both of which are customers of certain of\nour customers);\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n• inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n48"}

Various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws or taken actions that could limit (1) our ability to export\nor sell the products we manufacture and (2) our customers’ ability to export or sell products that we manufacture for them. The export of certain\ntechnologies from the United States and other nations to the PRC is barred by applicable export controls, and similar prohibitions could be extended to\nThailand, thereby limiting our ability to manufacture certain products. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to\nthe enforcement of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could limit our ability to offer our\nmanufacturing services to existing or potential customers, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFor example, the May 2019 addition of Huawei and certain affiliates by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (\"BIS\")\nto the BIS Entity List denied Huawei the ability to purchase products, software and technology that are subject to U.S. Export Administration Regulations.\nAlthough we do not sell directly to Huawei, some of our customers do sell to Huawei (and its affiliates) directly. To ensure compliance, some of our\ncustomers immediately suspended shipments to Huawei in order to assess whether their products were subject to the restrictions resulting from the ban.\nThis had an immediate impact on our customer orders in the three months ended June 28, 2019, which affected our revenue for that quarter. We expect this\nban to continue to adversely affect orders from our customers for the foreseeable future.\nWe are subject to risks related to changes in U.S. and international trade policies, including new or increased tariffs on materials that we use in\nmanufacturing, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn April 2025, the U.S. imposed global trade tariffs on a wide range of products and goods. Our business may be adversely affected by evolving\nglobal trade policies, including tariffs and other trade restrictions. We are subject to risks associated with changes in international trade policies,\nregulations, and relationships. In recent years, multiple countries, including the United States, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and members of the\nEuropean Union, among others have enacted tariffs, export controls, quotas, and other forms of trade restrictions on a variety of goods and services. These\nmeasures have led to increased costs, supply chain disruptions, and reduced demand across several industries. Although certain tariffs have been reduced or\ndelayed, the potential for future escalation or the imposition of new trade restrictions remains. Ongoing or future trade disputes may impact the availability\nand cost of materials used in our manufacturing processes. In some cases, suppliers may struggle to meet increased demand resulting from accelerated\npurchasing ahead of anticipated policy changes, further exacerbating supply chain instability. Additionally, retaliatory actions or changes in trade policies\nby foreign governments may reduce the demand for our customers’ products in impacted regions, which could lead to reduced orders and revenue for us. If\nwe are unable to mitigate the effects of increased costs or pass them on to our customers, our gross margins, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of current or future trade negotiations, the timing of any policy changes, or the impact such changes may have on our\nindustry, supply chain, or customer base.\nPolitical unrest and demonstrations, as well as changes in the political, social, business or economic conditions in Thailand, could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nThe majority of our assets and manufacturing operations are located in Thailand. Therefore, political, social, business and economic conditions in\nThailand have a significant effect on our business. Any changes to tax regimes, laws, exchange controls or political action in Thailand may harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nThailand has a history of political unrest that includes the involvement of the military as an active participant in the ruling government. In recent\nyears, political unrest in the country has sparked political demonstrations and, in some instances, violence. Any future political instability in Thailand could\nprevent shipments from entering or leaving the country, disrupt our\n49"}

Because these operations\nare located in the PRC, they are subject to greater political, legal and economic risks than the geographies in which the facilities of many of our competitors\nand customers are located. In particular, the political and economic climate in the PRC (both at national and regional levels) is fluid and unpredictable. A\nlarge part of the PRC’s economy is still being operated under varying degrees of control by the PRC government. By imposing industrial policies and other\neconomic measures, such as control of foreign exchange, taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, intellectual\nproperty and restrictions on foreign participation in the domestic market of various industries, the PRC government exerts considerable direct and indirect\ninfluence on the development of the PRC economy. Many of the economic reforms carried out by the PRC government are unprecedented or experimental\nand are expected to change further. Any changes to the political, legal or economic climate in the PRC could harm our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nOur PRC subsidiary is a “wholly foreign-owned enterprise” and is therefore subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in the\nPRC, in general, and laws and regulations applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises, in particular. The PRC has made significant progress in the\npromulgation of laws and regulations pertaining to economic matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce,\ntaxation and trade. However, the promulgation of new laws, changes in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may have a\nnegative impact on our business and prospects. In addition, these laws and regulations are relatively new, and published cases are limited in volume and\nnon-binding. Therefore, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. Laws may be changed with little\nor no prior notice, for political or other reasons. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to foreign investors. Furthermore, any\nlitigation in the PRC may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management’s attention.\nNatural disasters, epidemics, acts of terrorism and political and economic developments could harm our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our manufacturing operations and increase our supply chain costs. These events, over which we have little or\nno control, could cause a decrease in demand for our services, make it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture and deliver products or for our suppliers\nto deliver components allowing us to manufacture those products, require large expenditures to repair or replace our facilities, or create delays and\ninefficiencies in our supply chain. For example, the 2011 flooding in Thailand forced us to temporarily shut down all of our manufacturing facilities in\nThailand and cease production permanently at our former Chokchai facility, which adversely affected our ability to meet our customers’ demands during\nfiscal year 2012.\nIn some countries in which we operate, including the PRC, the U.S., and Thailand, outbreaks of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, H1N1\ninfluenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome or bird flu could disrupt our manufacturing operations, reduce demand for our customers’ products and\nincrease our supply chain costs. For example, the outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a two-week suspension of operations at our facility in Fuzhou, the\nPRC in February 2020 and caused labor shortages for us and some of our suppliers and customers in the PRC during the three months ended March 27,\n2020, which negatively affected our revenues during the same period.\nIn addition, increased international political instability, the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks, conflicts in the Middle East, Asia and Europe\n(including the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war), strained international relations arising from these conflicts and the related decline in\nconsumer confidence and economic weakness, may hinder our ability to do business. Any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt\nour operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed for our manufacturing services. Such\nevents may also disrupt the transportation of materials to our manufacturing facilities and finished products to our customers. These events have had, and\nmay continue to have, an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general, and customer confidence\n50"}

The impact of these events on the volatility of the\nU.S. and world financial markets also could increase the volatility of the market price of our ordinary shares and may limit the capital resources available to\nus, our customers and our suppliers.\nFinancial Risks\nUnfavorable worldwide economic conditions (including inflation and supply chain disruptions) may negatively affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nThe current volatility and adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets have negatively affected levels of business and consumer spending,\nheightening concerns about the likelihood of a global recession and potential default of various national bonds and debt backed by individual countries.\nSuch developments, as well as the policies impacting these, could adversely affect our financial results. In particular, the economic disruption caused by\nCOVID-19 has led to reduced demand in some of our customers’ optical communications product portfolios and significant volatility in global stock\nmarkets and currency exchange rates. Uncertainty about worldwide economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may further reduce or postpone\nspending in response to reduced budgets, tight credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results and increase the volatility of our share price. In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be\nrestricted, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions and could also adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nIn 2022 and 2023, inflation increased globally to levels not seen in decades. Although inflation rates have recently declined, inflation can adversely\naffect us by increasing the costs of labor and other expenses. There is no assurance that our revenues will increase at the same rate to maintain the same\nlevel of profitability. Inflation and government efforts to combat inflation, such as raising the benchmark interest rate, could increase market volatility and\nhave an adverse effect on the financial market and global economy. In addition, we expect that disruptions in our supply chain and fluctuations in the\navailability of parts and materials will continue to have a significant impact on our ability to generate revenue, despite strong demand from our customers.\nSuch adverse conditions could negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our shareholders.\nWe anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operating activities and funds available through our\nworking capital and credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes for at least the next 12\nmonths. However, we operate in a market that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate. It is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs. If this occurs, we may need additional financing to execute on our\ncurrent or future business strategies.\nFurthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders\ncould be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. If\nadequate additional funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage\nof unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our manufacturing services, hire additional technical and other personnel, or otherwise respond to\ncompetitive pressures could be significantly limited.\nOur investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets.\nWe use professional investment management firms to manage our excess cash and cash equivalents. Our short-term investments as of March 28,\n2025 are primarily investments in a fixed income portfolio, including liquidity funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits, corporate debt securities, and\nU.S. agency and U.S. Treasury securities. Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets. We follow an established\ninvestment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality\nstandards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. The policy also provides that we may not\ninvest in short-term investments with a maturity in excess of three years.\nShould financial market conditions worsen, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit\nconcerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and\n51"}

As of March 28, 2025, we did not record any impairment charges associated with our portfolio of short-term\ninvestments, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or\nmarket liquidity, or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.\nWe are not fully insured against all potential losses. Natural disasters or other catastrophes could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nOur current property and casualty insurance covers loss or damage to our property and third-party property over which we have custody and control,\nas well as losses associated with business interruption, subject to specified exclusions and limitations such as coinsurance, facilities location sub-limits and\nother policy limitations and covenants. Even with insurance coverage, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including acts of war, could cause us to\nsuffer substantial losses in our operational capacity and could also lead to a loss of opportunity and to a potential adverse impact on our relationships with\nour existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them, for which we might not be compensated by existing insurance. This in\nturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported\namounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are\ninherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,\nexpenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIntellectual Property and Cybersecurity Risks\nOur business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure and/or cyber\nsecurity attacks.\nWe rely upon the capacity, availability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure. For instance, we use a\ncombination of standard and customized software platforms to manage, record, and report all aspects of our operations and, in many instances, enable our\ncustomers to remotely access certain areas of our databases to monitor yields, inventory positions, work-in-progress status and vendor quality data. We are\nconstantly expanding and updating our information technology infrastructure in response to our changing needs. Any failure to manage, expand and update\nour information technology infrastructure or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure could harm our business.\nDespite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damage caused by computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized\naccess and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. To the extent that any\ndisruption, cyber-attack or other security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, our business\ncould be harmed. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in\nthe future.\nIntellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur services involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of intellectual property infringement claims\nfrom third parties and claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers.\nOur customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement arising out of our manufacturing processes.\nIf any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these claims have merit, we could be required to expend\nsignificant resources in defense of such claims. In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of time and money\nto develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable\nterms or at all, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n52"}

These products often contain our customers’ intellectual property, including\ntrade secrets and know-how. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our customers’ intellectual property. We may maintain separate and\nsecure areas for customer proprietary manufacturing processes and materials and dedicate floor space, equipment, engineers and supply chain management\nto protect our customers’ proprietary drawings, materials and products. The steps we take to protect our customers’ intellectual property may not\nadequately prevent its disclosure or misappropriation. If we fail to protect our customers’ intellectual property, our customer relationships could be harmed,\nand we may experience difficulty in establishing new customer relationships. In addition, our customers might pursue legal claims against us for any failure\nto protect their intellectual property, possibly resulting in harm to our reputation and our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTax, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to the risk of increased income taxes, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in Thailand, the PRC, the U.K., the U.S. and Israel. Our effective income tax rate, provision for income\ntaxes and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including the results of tax audits and examinations, income before taxes\nbeing lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in\nincome tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, failure to meet obligations with respect to tax exemptions, and changes in\ntax laws and regulations. From time to time, we engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.\nAs of March 28, 2025, our U.S. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for the tax years 2019 through 2022. The Company is currently\nunder examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023. In addition, tax returns that remain open to examination\nin Thailand, the PRC, the U.K. and Israel range from the tax years 2017 through 2023. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns\nand continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and tax liability.\nWe base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries\nin which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by tax authorities and to possible\nchanges in law, which may have retroactive effect. Fabrinet (the “Cayman Islands Parent”) is an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands.\nWe maintain manufacturing operations in Thailand, the PRC, the U.S. and Israel. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions\nmay require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to tax in the Cayman\nIslands on income or capital gains until March 6, 2039.\nPreferential tax treatment from the Thai government in the form of a corporate tax exemption on income generated from projects to manufacture\ncertain products at our Chonburi campus is available to us through June 2026. Similar preferential tax treatment was available to us through June 2020 with\nrespect to products manufactured at our Pinehurst campus. After June 2020, 50% of our income generated from products manufactured at our Pinehurst\ncampus will be exempted from tax through June 2025. Preferential tax treatment is available to us for products manufactured at our Chonburi campus\nBuilding 9, where income generated will be tax exempt through 2031, capped at our actual investment amount. Such preferential tax treatment is\ncontingent on various factors, including the export of our customers’ products out of Thailand and our agreement not to move our manufacturing facilities\nout of our current province in Thailand for at least 15 years from the date on which preferential tax treatment was granted. We will lose this favorable tax\ntreatment in Thailand unless we comply with these restrictions, and as a result we may delay or forego certain strategic business decisions due to these tax\nconsiderations.\nThere is also a risk that Thailand or another jurisdiction in which we operate may treat the Cayman Islands Parent as having a permanent\nestablishment in such jurisdiction and subject its income to tax. If we become subject to additional taxes in any jurisdiction or if any jurisdiction begins to\ntreat the Cayman Islands Parent as having a permanent establishment, such tax treatment could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nCertain of our subsidiaries provide products and services to, and may from time to time undertake certain significant transactions with, us and our\nother subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. For instance, we have intercompany agreements in place that provide for our California and Singapore\nsubsidiaries to provide administrative services for the Cayman Islands Parent, and the Cayman Islands Parent has entered into manufacturing agreements\nwith our Thai subsidiary.

Moreover, several jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate have tax laws with detailed transfer pricing rules that require all transactions with non-resident related parties to be priced using arm’s\nlength pricing principles and require the existence of contemporaneous documentation to support such pricing. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions could\nchallenge the validity of our related party transfer pricing policies. Such a challenge generally involves a complex area of taxation and a significant degree\nof judgment by management. If any tax authorities are successful in challenging our financing or transfer pricing policies, our income tax expense may be\nadversely affected and we could become subject to interest and penalty charges, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced that it has reached agreement among its member countries to\nimplement Pillar Two rules, a global minimum tax at 15% for certain multinational enterprises. The OECD has issued Pillar Two model rules and continues\nto release guidance on these rules. Many countries have enacted tax laws that will take effect in 2024 and 2025 to implement Pillar Two rules, while other\ncountries have announced plans to adopt these rules. We evaluated the applicable tax law changes resulting from Pillar Two implementation in the countries\nwhere we operate, and there was no material impact to our tax provision for the nine months ended March 28, 2025. As additional jurisdictions enact such\nlegislation in the future, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase. We will continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments\nrelated to global minimum tax matters to assess the impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will\nbe required to continue to devote substantial time to various compliance initiatives.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as other rules implemented by\nthe SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate\ngovernance practices. These and proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs. If\ncompliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns, it could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. While we were able to assert in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 28, 2024, we cannot predict the outcome of our\ntesting in future periods. If we are unable to assert in any future reporting periods that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our\nindependent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), we could lose investor\nconfidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on our share price.\nGiven the nature and complexity of our business and the fact that some members of our management team are located in Thailand while others are\nlocated in the U.S., control deficiencies may periodically occur. While we have ongoing measures and procedures to prevent and remedy control\ndeficiencies, if they occur there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that we will be able to prevent material weaknesses or significant\ndeficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Moreover, if we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial\nreporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses in future periods, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline and we could be subject to\npotential delisting by the NYSE and review by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require us to expend additional financial\nand management resources. As a result, our shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the market\nprice of our ordinary shares.\nIf we are unable to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for the products we manufacture,\nour business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nAs a manufacturer of products for the optics industry, we are required to meet certain certification standards, including the following: ISO 9001 for\nManufacturing Quality Management Systems; ISO 14001 for Environmental Management Systems; TL 9000 for Telecommunications Industry Quality\nCertification; IATF 16949 for Automotive Industry Quality Certification; ISO 13485 for Medical Devices Industry Quality Certification; AS 9100 for\nAerospace Industry Quality Certification; NADCAP (National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program) for Quality Assurance\nthroughout the Aerospace and Defense Industries; ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems; ISO/IEC 17025 for Testing and\nCalibration Laboratories Certification; ISO 22301 for Business Continuity Management Systems; and ISO/IEC 27001 for Information Security\nManagement Systems. We also maintain compliance with various additional standards imposed by the FDA with respect to the manufacture of medical\ndevices.\n54"}

We hold the following additional certifications:\nANSI ESD S20.20 for facilities and manufacturing process control, in compliance with ESD standard; Transported Asset Protection Association (\"TAPA\")\nand Custom Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (\"C-TPAT\") for Logistic Security Management System; and CSR-DIW for Corporate Social\nResponsibility in Thailand. In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our precision optical, electro-\nmechanical and electronic manufacturing services and we must undergo periodic inspections by regulatory bodies to obtain and maintain these\ncertifications. If any regulatory inspection reveals that we are not in compliance with applicable standards, regulators may take action against us, including\nissuing a warning letter, imposing fines on us, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, or closing our manufacturing facilities.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it could harm our reputation as well as our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand operating results.\nThe sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental laws and regulations. In addition, rules\nadopted by the SEC implementing the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 impose diligence and disclosure\nrequirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in the products we\nmanufacture for our customers. Compliance with these rules has resulted in additional cost and expense, including for due diligence to determine and verify\nthe sources of any conflict minerals used in the products we manufacture, and may result in additional costs of remediation and other changes to processes\nor sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the\nproducts we manufacture, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals that can be used in the products we\nmanufacture for our customers.\nAlthough we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and these laws and regulations, we will need to\nensure that we and, in some cases, our suppliers comply with applicable laws and regulations. If we fail to timely comply with such laws and regulations,\nour customers may cease doing business with us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In\naddition, if we were found to be in violation of these laws, we could be subject to governmental fines, liability to our customers and damage to our\nreputation, which would also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares\nOur share price may be volatile due to fluctuations in our operating results and other factors, including the activities and operating results of\nour customers or competitors, any of which could cause our share price to decline.\nOur revenues, expenses and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-\nyear due to the risk factors described in this section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to market and industry factors, the\nprice and trading volume of our ordinary shares may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors relating to us, our competitors, our customers\nand the markets we serve, many of which are beyond our control. Factors such as variations in our total revenues, earnings and cash flow, announcements\nof new investments or acquisitions, changes in our pricing practices or those of our competitors, commencement or outcome of litigation, sales of ordinary\nshares by us or our principal shareholders, fluctuations in market prices for our services and general market conditions could cause the market price of our\nordinary shares to change substantially. Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares\ntrade. Volatility and weakness in our share price could mean that investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices they paid and could\nalso impair our ability in the future to offer our ordinary shares or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and/or as consideration in the\nacquisition of other businesses.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices\nof equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or\ninternational currency fluctuations, may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in\nthe market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities\nlitigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our\nbusiness.\n55"}

If securities or industry analysts stop covering us, or if too few analysts cover us, the market price of our ordinary shares could be adversely\nimpacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our ordinary shares or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business,\nour market price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our\nordinary shares could decrease, which could cause the market price or trading volume of our ordinary shares to decline.\nWe may become a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences to U.S. investors.\nBased upon estimates of the value of our assets, which are based in part on the trading price of our ordinary shares, we do not expect to be a passive\nforeign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year 2024 or for the foreseeable future. However, despite our\nexpectations, we cannot guarantee that we will not become a PFIC for the taxable year 2024 or any future year because our PFIC status is determined at the\nend of each year and depends on the\ncomposition of our income and assets during such year. If we become a PFIC, our U.S. investors will be subject to increased tax liabilities under U.S. tax\nlaws and regulations as well as burdensome reporting requirements.\nOur business and share price could be negatively affected as a result of activist shareholders.\nIf an activist investor takes an ownership position in our ordinary shares, responding to actions by such activist shareholder could be costly and time-\nconsuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees.

If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or do business with our competitors\ninstead of us because of any such issues, then our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, our share\nprice could experience periods of increased volatility as a result of shareholder activism.\nCertain provisions in our constitutional documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which could limit our shareholders'\nopportunity to sell shares at a premium.\nOur constitutional documents include provisions that could limit the ability of others to acquire control of us, modify our structure or cause us to\nengage in change-of-control transactions, including, among other things, provisions that:\n• establish a classified board of directors;\n• prohibit our shareholders from calling meetings or acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n• limit the ability of our shareholders to propose actions at duly convened meetings; and\n• authorize our board of directors, without action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares and additional ordinary shares.\nThese provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their ordinary shares at a premium over prevailing\nmarket prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to acquire control of us in a tender offer or similar transaction.\nOur shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (“MOA”), by the Companies Law (as\namended) of the Cayman Islands and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our\ndirectors under the laws of the Cayman Islands are not as clearly established under statutes or judicial precedent as in jurisdictions in the U.S. Therefore,\nour shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the U.S.,\ndue to the comparatively less developed nature of Cayman Islands law in this area.\n56"}

Dissenting shareholders have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be\ndetermined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow the required procedures, subject to certain exceptions. Court approval is not required for a merger\nor consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures.\nIn addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is\napproved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must in addition\nrepresent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy\nat a meeting convened for that purpose. The convening of the meeting and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the\nCayman Islands. A dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved.\nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90.0% of the shares within four months, the offeror may, within a two-month period,\nrequire the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman\nIslands but is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.\nIf the arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would\notherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the U.S., providing rights to receive payment\nin cash for the judicially determined value of the shares. This may make it more difficult for our shareholders to assess the value of any consideration they\nmay receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give them additional consideration if they believe the consideration offered is\ninsufficient.\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or\nto obtain copies of lists of shareholders.

This may make it more difficult\nfor our shareholders to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders\nin connection with a proxy contest.\nSubject to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors.\nCertain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable.\nThe Cayman Islands Parent is a Cayman Islands exempted company and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the U.S. Given our\ndomicile and the location of our assets, it may be difficult to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts based on the civil liability\nprovisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands, Thailand or the PRC would\nrecognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. or any state. In\nparticular, a judgment in a U.S. court would not be recognized and accepted by Thai courts without a re-trial or examination of the merits of the case. In\naddition, there is uncertainty as to whether such Cayman Islands, Thai or PRC courts would be competent to hear original actions brought in the Cayman\nIslands, Thailand or the PRC against us predicated upon the securities laws of the U.S. or any state.\nGeneral Risks\nEnergy price volatility may negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources in our manufacturing and transportation activities. Energy prices have\nbeen subject to increases and general volatility caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuation, production and transportation\ndisruption, world events and government regulations. While we are currently experiencing lower energy prices, a significant increase is possible, which\ncould increase our raw material and transportation costs. In addition, increased transportation costs of our suppliers and customers could be passed along to\nus. We may not be able to increase our prices to adequately offset these increased costs, and any increase in our prices may reduce our future customer\norders, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n57"}
