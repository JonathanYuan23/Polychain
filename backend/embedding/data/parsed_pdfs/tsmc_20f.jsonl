KEY INFORMATION\nCapitalization and Indebtedness\nNot applicable.\nReasons for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\nRisk Factors\nWe wish to caution readers that the following important factors, and those important factors described in other reports submitted to, or filed with,\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“U.S. SEC”), among other factors, could affect our actual results and could cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, and that such factors may adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial status and therefore the value of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nAny global systemic political, economic and financial crisis (as well as the indirect effects flowing therefrom) could negatively affect our business,\nresults of operations, and financial condition.\nIn recent times, several major systemic political, economic and financial crises negatively affected global business, banking and financial sectors,\nincluding the semiconductor industry and markets.\nSince 2018, there have been political and trade tensions among a number of the world’s major economies. These tensions have resulted or may\nresult in the implementation of tariff, non-tariff trade barriers, sanctions, export controls and other measures that have been particularly impactful to the\nsemiconductor industry and related markets. Prolonged or increased use of such measures may negatively impact the growth of the global economy and\nthe semiconductor industry, resulting in declines in electronic products sales from which we generate our income through our products and services. For\nexample, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on April 2, 2025 a 10% baseline tariff on imports into the United States from all countries, as well as\nvarying reciprocal tariffs on certain trading partners, including Taiwan. The varying reciprocal tariffs, except those on Chinese goods, were then paused\nuntil July 9, 2025; imports subject to variable reciprocal tariffs will instead be subject to the baseline 10% tariff during the period. Semiconductors were\nnot subject to the reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2, 2025. However, given ongoing discussions between the United States and its trading partners,\nthere remains significant uncertainty about whether the United States may further change the scope and level of tariffs it imposes, including any\npotential tariffs it may impose on semiconductor imports. Any tariffs imposed on imports of semiconductors and products incorporating chips into the\nUnited States may result in increased costs for purchasing such products, which may, in turn, lead to decreased demand for our products and services\nand adversely affect our business and future growth. Also, any increase in the use of export control restrictions and sanctions to target certain countries\nand entities, any expansion of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of such measures, or complete or partial ban on semiconductor products sales to certain\nentities could impact not only our ability to continue supplying products to those customers, but also our customers’ demand for our products, and could\neven lead to changes in semiconductor supply chains. For example, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd.\nand its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”) in 2020. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of products to Huawei\nsince September 2020. In October 2022 and October 2023, the U.S. adopted additional export controls (the “October Rules”) over specified countries\n(including China) under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“U.S. EAR”) on certain advanced computing integrated circuits (“ICs”), computer\ncommodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for\nsupercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end-uses. The controls impose license requirements for items subject to the U.S. EAR where the items\nare destined to a semiconductor fabrication facility in China that fabricates ICs meeting specified advanced node parameters as well as for U.S. persons’\nactivities supporting such facility or semiconductor manufacturing items. In response, we obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce a Validated\nEnd-User (the “VEU”) authorization for our fab located in Nanjing, China, which is a permanent authorization that allows our fab in Nanjing to receive\nexports of eligible items from the U.S. without separate licenses. However, there is no assurance that the VEU authorization we obtained will not be\nterminated in the future. The restrictions imposed by the October Rules on exports of advanced computing ICs are further reinforced by the U.S.’ new\nrules issued in January 2025. Under the new rules, we may need to obtain an export license prior to shipping products using 16-nanometer or below\nprocess to any global destination unless specific conditions are met. As a result, shipments of certain products may be delayed or prohibited due to the\nlicense requirements and our financial results may be adversely affected.\n/nobreakspace\n3"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 10, "text": "On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract the impact of another country’s actions or regulations could lead to\nsignificant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among\nother matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational’s compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies. As of the date of\nthis annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected by the expanded export control regulations or the novel rules or\nmeasures adopted to counteract them. Nevertheless, depending on future developments in global trade tensions and military conflicts, such regulations,\nrules, or measures may have an adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a\nresult. Please see “Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations material to our operations, such as export control, environmental and\nclimate related laws and regulations, or the inability to timely obtain requisite approvals necessary for the conduct of our business, such as fab land and\nconstruction approvals, could harm our business and operational results or subject us to potential significant legal liability” for a further discussion.\nAny future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate\nfluctuations, inflation or deflation or changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies, could cause revenue or profits for the\nsemiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically. If the economic conditions or financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate, the\ndemand for our products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce our operating\nincome and net income. In addition, sufficient external financing may not be available to us on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to us,\nor at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when we need such financing to meet our capital requirements, we may be forced to curtail our\nexpansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until we obtain such financing. In conclusion, any of these events,\nincluding any future global systemic crisis or further escalation of trade tensions as described above, could materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations.\nOur global manufacturing, design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with political, economic, financial, military or other conditions\nor developments in various jurisdictions, including in particular the R.O.C., as well as in international trade, which could negatively affect our\nbusiness and financial status and therefore the market value of your investment.\nThe majority of our principal executive officers and our principal production facilities are located in the R.O.C., and the majority of our net\nrevenue is derived from our operations in the R.O.C. In addition, we have operations worldwide and a significant percentage of our revenue comes from\nsales to locations outside the R.O.C. Operating in the R.O.C. and overseas exposes us to changes in laws, rules, regulations and the enforcements of such\nlaws, rules and regulations in certain key areas that could have a material impact on our operations, such as intellectual property, labor, antitrust, export\ncontrol, import restrictions, and trade barriers or disputes. In addition, deterioration in general political, economic, financial or social conditions, military\nconflicts, the risk of outbreak of war or hostilities, terrorism events, security risks, social unrest, health conditions and possible disruptions in\ntransportation networks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate or elsewhere, could have an adverse impact on our business and results of\noperations as well as the market price and the liquidity of our ADSs and common shares. Furthermore, any major change in economic, fiscal and/or\ntrade policies in the U.S. from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue or in another major jurisdiction could severely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For example, recent political and trade tensions among major economies as well as military conflicts (such\nas the conflict in Ukraine since early 2022) have resulted in the imposition of trade barriers, such as sanctions and import and export controls, which\ncould increase our manufacturing costs, limit our access to certain supplies, make our pricing less competitive, and limit our ability to offer our products\nand services in some markets or source key materials and key production equipment, which may have adverse direct or indirect effects on our sales.\nAny law or government policy that encourages our customers to relocate their manufacturing capacity or supply chain to their own countries or\nrequire their respective contractors, subcontractors and relevant agents to do so could also impair our ability to sustain our current level of productivity\nand manufacturing efficiency. An important aspect of our business operation is an ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and\nsuppliers in the R.O.C. that provides us with significant operational synergies, flexibility and efficiencies. For example, we are able to temporarily\nreassign thousands of our engineers and other relevant personnel from one manufacturing site to another to refine specific designs and adapt\nmanufacturing processes in a timely manner. These advantages permit us to operate our manufacturing fabs efficiently and resolve any technical or\ncommercial difficulties quickly to maintain our competitive edge. Restrictions on our ability to transfer people among our operations in the R.O.C., the\nUnited States, the P.R.C., Japan, and Europe efficiently due to challenges such as regional employment rules and regulations, and immigration or travel\nrestrictions, may impair or reduce these advantages, and we may not be able to sustain our current ability to supply our customers with goods and\nservices at the current level of cost, quality, quantity and delivery schedule to which our customers have been accustomed.\n/nobreakspace\n4"}

Also, the R.O.C. government has not lifted some trade and investment\nrestrictions imposed on R.O.C. companies on the amount and types of certain investments that can be made in the P.R.C. Our plans, investment\napplications and/or any relevant regulatory approvals to establish or possibly expand operations in the P.R.C. may be delayed, interrupted, suspended or\ncancelled due to unforeseeable social and political factors in the R.O.C. or the P.R.C., and these potential operational risks can be aggravated by\napplicable export controls which impose license requirements on our P.R.C. fab’s acquisition of certain manufacturing tools.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the complexity of our global operations and deal with the challenges and risks related to our global\nexpansion, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have multiple expansion projects that are currently underway, including the design and construction of new fabs worldwide.

We expect to face particular challenges in global\nexpansion and operations, including but not limited to:\n/nobreakspace\n \n•  higher costs associated with construction of new fabs, establishing supply chains for various materials in different overseas  locations, the\nimpact on our ability to sustain our current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency provided by our ecosystem of\ninterconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and suppliers in the R.O.C., and recruiting and retaining talent in various overseas\nlocations;\n/nobreakspace\n \n•  labor shortages, interruptions in the supply chains for various materials, and construction issues, which could substantially  delay the\ncompletion of our expansion projects, and could further result in substantial additional costs or failure to meet our capacity expansion\nplans;\n/nobreakspace\n \n•  disruptions to our operations caused by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, t sunamis,\nsandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage or spill, pandemic, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, geopolitical\ntensions, labor issues, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment and disruptions in utilities, such as water, electricity and natural\ngas, etc.;\n/nobreakspace\n •  scarcity of industrial-use land, which could limit our future expansion of operations;\n/nobreakspace\n •  compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, and the risk of penalties if our practices are deemed not to be in compliance;\n/nobreakspace\n •  challenges in managing information technology infrastructure in multiple locations and across different systems and risks of our\ninformation technology infrastructure succumbing to cyberattacks worldwide;\n/nobreakspace\n •  adverse changes relating to government grants or other government incentives, including non-receipt, delay and potential claw  backs of\ngovernment subsidies;\n/nobreakspace\n •  challenges in creating an inclusive workplace in new sites to embrace the cultural differences and managing the operation ove r large\ngeographic distances and in context of different employment practices and labor laws and regulations;\n/nobreakspace\n •  limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing our rights to intellectual property; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  exposure to different tax jurisdictions and potential adverse tax consequences.\nIf we are unable to overcome the above challenges, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDecreases in demand and average selling prices for products that contain semiconductors may adversely affect demand for our products and may\nresult in a decrease in our revenue and earnings.\nA vast majority of our revenue is derived from customers who use our products in HPC (including AI applications), smartphones, IoT, automotive,\nand digital consumer electronics. Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand\nfor overall global semiconductor foundry services, including our products and services, could adversely affect our revenue. Further, semiconductor\nmanufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost assets once they are in operation. Because we own most of\nour manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or our\ncapacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease our margins. Conversely, as\nproduct demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve our margins. In addition, the\nhistorical trend of declining average selling prices (“ASP”) of end-use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go\ninto such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end-use applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by us, which, in turn, may\nnegatively impact our revenue, margin and earnings.\n/nobreakspace\n5"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 12, "text": "Since we are dependent on the highly cyclical semiconductor and electronics industries, which have experienced significant and sometimes\nprolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity, our revenue, margins and earnings may fluctuate significantly.\nThe electronics industries and semiconductor market are cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid fluctuations in product demand, which\ncould impact our semiconductor foundry business. Variations in customer order levels may result in volatility in our revenue and earnings. From time to\ntime, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity.\nBecause we are, and will continue to be, dependent on the demand of electronics and semiconductor companies for our services, periods of downturns\nand overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services,\nincluding our services. If we are not able to take appropriate actions, such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, our revenue,\nmargins and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity.\nIf we are unable to remain a technological leader in the semiconductor industry, unable to timely respond to fast-changing semiconductor market\ndynamics, or unable to maintain our edge in product quality, we may become less competitive.\nThe semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. We compete by developing process technologies using increasingly\nadvanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. We also compete by developing new derivative technologies. If we do not anticipate\nthese changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or our competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional\ntechnologies, we may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. For example, the global surge in the development of AI has had a\nsignificant impact on customer demand for advanced semiconductor chips and the market dynamics in our industry; thus, our ability to continuously\ndevelop relevant technologies, products and services to meet these customer needs and changes in the AI industry will be critical for us to effectively\ncompete in this space. We also believe that the effective use of AI in our internal operations is important to our long-term success. As the AI\ntechnologies are rapidly evolving, if we are unable to deploy new AI technologies in our internal operations as effectively as our competitors, it may hurt\nour competitive position. In addition, our customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the\nmarket. If we are unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, we risk losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the\nshift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all\nfurther discussed among these risk factors). Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving\nexpected product quality and product yield. If we fail to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business\nor customer trust. If we are unable to overcome the above factors, we may become less competitive and our revenue may decline significantly.\nIn light of the rise of new foundry service providers worldwide, if we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive foundry segment of\nthe semiconductor industry, including through equal access to governmental financial incentives, especially those available to our competitors, we\nmay lose customers and/or our profit margin and earnings may decrease.\nThe competition in the semiconductor foundry segment is fierce. We compete with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of\nintegrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced or different technologies than us. Other companies may\nhave greater financial and other resources than us, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds,\nor other incentives that may be unavailable to us. The governments of the United States, China, Europe, South Korea and Japan provide various\nincentive programs to promote developments of their domestic semiconductor industries, such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce\nSemiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (the “U.S. CHIPS Act”), which provides financial incentives to incentivize the development of U.S.\nsemiconductor industry. In November 2024, TSMC Arizona Corporation (“TSMC Arizona”) entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of\nCommerce for the receipt of certain incentives pursuant to the U.S. CHIPS Act, which includes up to US$6.6 billion in total direct funding and up to\nUS$5 billion of proposed loans. Please see “Item 4. Information on The Company – Our Subsidiaries and Affiliates.” In December 2024, ESMC, our\nsubsidiary in Germany, entered into an agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany for the receipt of up to EUR5 billion state aid under the\nEuropean Chips Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/1781). Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where we are currently expanding or\nplanning to expand our production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to us, there is no assurance that we\nwill be able to receive such financial incentives, including pursuant to the U.S. CHIPS Act, at the levels we anticipate or at all. Additionally, any\nfinancial incentives we receive may be subject to conditions and requirements imposed by the grantors, such as restrictions on the expansion of facilities\nin foreign countries of concern and on joint research and technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern on any technology or product that\nraises national security concerns. Noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the grants that we may receive could result in a delay or forfeiture of\nall or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as obligate us to repay all or a portion of amounts already received pursuant to the grants.\nEven if we satisfy the conditions and requirements for the funding disbursement, it is possible that the grantor may delay the disbursement or be unable\nto provide the funding. While we expect to continue benefiting from government incentives, failure to obtain grants that we seek, to fully utilize\navailable grants, or to comply with the terms and conditions of grants could impact our ability to achieve our goals for the projects that would otherwise\nbenefit from grant funding and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n/nobreakspace\n6"}

Our\ncompetitors may also compete for our customers who seek to diversify their supply chains. These competitive activities may decrease our customer\nbase, our pricing, or both. If we are unable to compete effectively with such competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality, supply\nchain diversification and resilience, and customer satisfaction, we risk losing customers or business to such contenders.\nIf we are unable to manage our capacity and production facilities effectively, our competitiveness may be weakened.\nWe perform long-term market demand forecasts on a regular basis for our products and services to manage our overall capacity. Based on market\ndemand, we have continued to add capacity to meet market needs for our products and services, including in Taiwan, in Arizona, U.S., in Kumamoto,\nJapan and in Dresden, Germany.\nImplementing these capacity expansion plans will increase our costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, we would need to build\nnew facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If we do not increase our net revenue\naccordingly, our financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs. See “Item 4. Information on The Company – Capacity\nManagement and Technology Upgrade Plans” for a further discussion.\nIn addition, market conditions are dynamic, and our market demand forecasts may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased\ndemand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of our manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand\nsubsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, we may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn.\nIn such circumstances, our financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.\nHaving one or more large customers that account for a significant percentage of our revenue may render us vulnerable to the loss of or significant\ncurtailment of purchases by such customers that could in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, the increasing consolidation of\nour customers may further increase our revenue concentration.\nOver the years, our customer profile and the nature of our customers’ business have changed dramatically. While we generate revenue from\nhundreds of customers worldwide, our ten largest customers in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for approximately, 68%, 70% and 76% of our net\nrevenue in the respective year. Our largest customer in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for 23%, 25% and 22% of our net revenue in the respective year.\nOur second largest customer in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for less than 10%, 11%, and 12% of our net revenue in the respective year. A more\nconcentrated customer base will subject our revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from our large customers and cause different seasonal patterns in\nour business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile and\nHPC devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.\nThere are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, we have seen changes in\nthe nature of our customers’ business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend among system\ncompanies designing their own semiconductors and working directly with the semiconductor foundries, which makes their products and services more\nmarketable in a changing consumer market. These shifting business models could lead to significant variations in our sales if the growth of their\nproducts and services, particularly in the AI sector, is volatile or not sustainable.\nAlso, since the global semiconductor industry has become increasingly competitive, some of our customers have engaged in industry\nconsolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of our major customers\nconsolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of our customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export controls directed at\nour major customers, could impact our ability to supply products to those customers or reduce those customers’ demand for our products and services\nand thus impact their business operations.\n/nobreakspace\n7"}

In the event of a serious cyberattack, our systems may lose important corporate data or our production lines may be shut down\npending the resolution of such attack. Major cyberattacks could also lead to loss or divulgence of trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as\nproprietary information of our customers and other stakeholders and personal information of our employees. While we seek to continuously review and\nassess our cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, we cannot guarantee that we will not be susceptible to new\nand emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. For example, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could also use\nAI to develop malicious codes and sophisticated phishing attempts.\nMalicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into our network systems to disrupt our\noperations, blackmail us to regain control of our computing systems, or spy on us for sensitive information.

We have implemented and continually update\nrigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. See “Item 16K. Cybersecurity” for a further discussion. While\nthese ongoing enhancements further improve our cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that we are immune to cyberattacks.\nIn addition, we employ certain third-party service providers for us and our affiliates worldwide with whom we need to share highly sensitive and\nconfidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. While we require such third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the\nconfidentiality and/or internet security requirements in our service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will comply with such\nobligations. Moreover, such third-party service providers may also be susceptible to cyberattacks. If we or our service providers are not able to timely\nresolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of our data (and data belonging to our\ncustomers and other third parties) or maintain control of our or our service providers’ computing systems, our commitments to our customers and other\nstakeholders may be materially impaired and our results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and\nadversely affected.\nWe may not be able to implement our planned growth and development or maintain our leading position if we are unable to recruit and retain key\nexecutives, managers and skilled technical and service personnel.\nWe rely on the continued services and contributions of our management team, as well as skilled technical and professional personnel. Our business\ncould suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, talent\nshortages, illegal talent poaching, immigration controls, or related changes in market demand for our products and services. Since there is fierce\ncompetition for talent recruitment, we cannot ensure timely fulfillment of our personnel demand.\nWe may be unable to obtain in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost equipment that is necessary for us to remain competitive.\nOur operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on our ability to obtain necessary equipment and related services available from a limited\nnumber of suppliers. As a result, we may encounter the situation of limited supply and/or long delivery cycles. To better manage our supply chain, we\nevaluate and project delivery lead times to minimize the impact of supply chain risks on operating costs. We have also implemented various\ncollaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead time. To enhance\nour sourcing capabilities for our global sites, we have also taken steps to strengthen our understanding of local regulations, policies, and supply chains.\nHowever, if we are unable to acquire in a timely manner the equipment and parts we need, we may fail to successfully implement capacity expansion\nplans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability\nof, key equipment, through delay or denial of necessary export licenses, adoption of additional export control measures and other tariff or non-tariff\nbarriers.

In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific suppliers or by the\nsemiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters,\ntrade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation, occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials\nmay also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since we procure some of our raw materials from sole-\nsourced suppliers, there is a risk that our need for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Importation\nand domestic production limitations may also restrict our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary\nquality. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other\nnon-tariff barriers. Our revenue and earnings could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a\ntimely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials.\nAny inability to obtain, preserve, enforce, defend and protect our technologies, intellectual property rights and third-party licenses could harm our\ncompetitive position.\nOur ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio.\nWhile we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the\nmisappropriation or improper use of our proprietary technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, we cannot assure you that, as our business\nor business models expand into new areas, we will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how\nnecessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, we may\nhave to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that we rely on licenses from others, there can be\nno assurance that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms we consider reasonable or at all. The lack of\nnecessary licenses could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in\ninstances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.\nWe have received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies,\nasserting that our technologies, our manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by us or the use of those semiconductors by\nour customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, our market position, and the\nexpansion of our manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, we may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The\nassertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in\nseeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase our cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if\nthese asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by us. See “Item 8. Financial Information – Legal\nProceedings” for a further discussion. Also, with the expansion of our manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C jurisdictions, we have faced\nincreased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation.

Most of our\nproduction facilities, as well as those of many of our suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing\nservices, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity and/or water, which could cause interruptions\nto our operations. In April 2024 and January 2025, several earthquakes struck Taiwan, causing damage to our inventories, plant facilities, machinery and\nequipment. We recognized approximately NT$3 billion and NT$5.3 billion in losses from earthquakes, net of insurance claim, respectively, in the\nsecond quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025.\nIf one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to our operations or those of our customers or suppliers, or if any of our fabs or\nvendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an unforeseen disruptive event, it could reduce our manufacturing capacity and\ncause the loss of important customers, and thereby have an adverse, material impact on our operational and financial performance.\nOur operations may be interrupted, and our expansion may be limited, by power or other utility outages or shortages, and our financial results may\nbe adversely affected by increased prices of power or other utilities.\nWe have occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by our electricity supplier or other power\nconsumers on the same power grid. Some of these incidents have resulted in interruptions to our operations. Such outages, shortages or interruptions in\nelectricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If we are unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted\nsupply of electricity for our manufacturing fabs, our ability to fill customers’ orders would be jeopardized. Moreover, we have encountered and may\ncontinue to encounter increases in the prices of utilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, we became subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in\nTaiwan, which increased by 25% as compared to the tariff rate applicable to us in 2023. In October 2024, the electricity tariff rate further increased by\n14%. The hike in electricity prices could increase our manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, due to climate change, severe weather events, such as droughts, and any measures taken by governments in response to such severe\nweather events may materially affect our operations and our suppliers’ production. For example, the measures taken by governments in response to\ndroughts, including water rationing and conservation, may cause interruption to our operations or our expansion plans.\nIf such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, our operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse fluctuations in exchange rates could decrease our operating margin and/or revenue.\nSubstantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of our capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the\nNT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT\ndollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on our revenue and\noperating profit as expressed in NT dollars. For example, every 1% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an\napproximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in our operating margin based on our 2024 results.\nConversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of our customers\nand for our goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect our revenue.

Despite our best efforts to comply with all relevant export control and sanctions laws and regulations, there is no assurance\nthat our business activities will not be found incompliant with export control laws and regulations.\nComplying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require us, among\nother things, to do the following: (a) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (b) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation\nprograms and air pollution reduction plans; (c) modify our product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as\npaying any incurred carbon fees if our emission levels exceed applicable thresholds, and obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy\ncertificates or carbon credits, substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for our operations.\nOur inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of our business could impair our operational and financial results. For example,\nif we are unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion\nproject, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of our expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect our business and\noperational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, our operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or\ndelayed in response to public concern and social environmental pressures even if we comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\nFor further details, please see our compliance record with Taiwan and international environmental and climate related laws and regulations as well\nas our business continuity management of climate change policy in “Item 4. Information on The Company – Environmental and Climate Related Laws\nand Regulations”.\nAny adverse results of potential antitrust proceedings that we may be subject to could harm our business and operational results or subject us to\npotential significant legal liability.\nWe are subject to antitrust laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions, and from time to time receive related inquiries from enforcement\nagencies. With our success in the foundry business and the increasing criticism on the concentration of the semiconductor industry and sometimes\ndirectly on us, we are subject to heightened risks of antitrust investigations. In September 2017, we were contacted by the European Commission, which\nasked us for information and documents concerning alleged anti-competitive practices in relation to semiconductor sales.

If certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge. We are\nnot able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect\non our net income.\nThe determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent\nto that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when our operating results are otherwise already depressed. See\n“Item 5. Operating and Financial Reviews and Prospects – Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty” for\na discussion of how we assess if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.\nAny failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent\nfraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and corruption, our reputation and\nresults of operations could be harmed.\nWe are required to comply with various R.O.C. and U.S. laws and regulations on internal controls, but internal controls may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements because of their inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, fraud or\ncorruption.\nTherefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial\nstatements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our\nreporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and ADSs.\nAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the R.O.C., the United States or other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate our business may have an adverse effect on our net income.\nWhile we are subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct business, our principal operations are in\nthe R.O.C. and we are exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. Any unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in these\njurisdictions could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our operating results. Further, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions\ncould arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project that was undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (“OECD”). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on our operating results. See “Item 5.

The decrease\nwas partially offset by an increase in orders from China of NT$21,985 million, or a 9% year-over-year increase.\nWe provide worldwide customer support. Our office in Hsinchu and subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Japan, China, Germany, the\nNetherlands and South Korea are dedicated to serving our customers worldwide. Foundry services, which are both technologically and logistically\nintensive, involve frequent and in-depth interaction with customers. We believe that the most effective means of providing foundry services is by\ndeveloping direct and close relationships with our customers. Our customer service and technical support managers work closely with the sales force to\noffer integrated services to customers. To facilitate customer interaction and information access on a real-time basis, a suite of web-based applications\nhave also been offered to provide more active interactions with customers in design, engineering and logistics.\nAdvance Payment by Customers. Because of the fast-changing technology and functionality in semiconductor design, foundry customers\ngenerally do not place purchase orders far in advance to manufacture a particular type of product. However, some of our customers have entered into\nagreements with us to pay temporary receipts in order to retain specified capacity at our fabs. The treatment of advance temporary receipts, either by\nrefund or by accounts receivable offsetting, will be determined by mutual consent when the terms and conditions set forth in the agreements are\nsatisfied. See note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nThe Semiconductor Fabrication Process\nIn general, the semiconductor manufacturing process begins with a thin silicon wafer on which an array of semiconductor devices is fabricated.\nThe following processes cover assembly, packaging, and testing of the semiconductor devices. Our focus is on wafer fabrication although we also\nprovide other services either directly or through outsourcing arrangements.\nOur Foundry Services\nRange of Services. Because of our ability to provide a full array of services, we are able to accommodate customers with a variety of needs at\nevery stage of the overall foundry process. The flexibility in input stages allows us to cater to a variety of customers with different in-house capabilities\nand thus to service a wider class of customers as compared to a foundry that cannot offer design or mask making services, for example. As we serve a\nlarge global customer base that entails a wide range of applications, such customer diversification helps to smooth fluctuations in demand.\nFabrication Processes. We manufacture semiconductors mainly using the CMOS process. The CMOS process is currently the mainstream\nsemiconductor manufacturing process. We use the CMOS process to manufacture logic semiconductors, mixed-signal/radio frequency semiconductors,\nwhich combine analog and digital circuitry in a single semiconductor, micro-electro-mechanical-systems (“MEMS”), which combines micrometer\nfeatured mechanical parts, analog and digital circuitry in a single semiconductor, and embedded memory semiconductors, which combine logic and\nmemory in a single semiconductor, etc.\n/nobreakspace\n16"}

The decrease was partially offset by an increase from Automotive of NT$17,273 million, or a 15% year-over-year increase.\nDesign and Technology Platforms. Modern integrated circuit designers need sophisticated design infrastructure to optimize productivity and\ncycle time. Such infrastructure includes design flow for electronic design automation (“EDA”), silicon proven building blocks such as libraries and\nintellectual properties, simulation and verification design kits such as PDK and technology files. All of this infrastructure is built on top of the\ntechnology foundation, and each technology needs its own design infrastructure to be usable for designers. This is the concept of our technology\nplatforms.\nFor years, we and our alliance partners have spent considerable effort, time and resources to build our technology platforms. We unveiled an Open\nInnovation Platform® (“OIP”) initiative in 2008 to further enhance our technologies offerings. More OIP deliverables were introduced over the years, as\nwell as in 2024. In the design methodology area, we announced EDA and intellectual property readiness of 2-nanometer and 3-nanometer, as well as\ncontinuous development of solutions to enhance power, performance and area (“PPA”) on existing production technology nodes. In addition, we also\nannounced the openness of 3Dblox Standard to the semiconductor industry, as well as the availability of various 3-Dimensional Integrated Circuit\n(“3DIC”) reference flows to support TSMC 3DFabric® technologies in 3D silicon stacking and advanced packaging which cover a wide range of\nsystem-level design applications.\n/nobreakspace\n18"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 25, "text": "Multi-project Wafer Program (“CyberShuttle®”). To help our customers reduce costs, we offer a dedicated multi-project wafer processing service\nthat allows us to provide multiple customers with circuits produced with the same mask. This program reduces mask costs by a very significant amount,\nresulting in accelerated time-to-market for our customers. We have extended this program to all of our customers and library and intellectual property\npartners using our broad selection of process technologies, ranging from the latest 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 12-, 16-, 22-, 28-, 40-, 45-, 55-, 65- and 90-\nnanometer processes to 0.13-, 0.18-, 0.25-, 0.35- and 0.5-micron. This extension offers a routinely scheduled multi-project wafer run to customers on a\nshared-cost basis for prototyping and verification.\nWe developed our multi-project wafer program in response to the current SoC development methodologies, which often require the independent\ndevelopment, prototyping and validation of several intellectual properties before they can be integrated onto a single device. By sharing mask costs\namong our customers to the extent permissible, the SoC supplier can enjoy reduced prototyping costs and greater confidence that the design will be\nsuccessful.\nCustomer Service\nWe believe that our dedication to customer service has been an indispensable factor in attracting new customers, helping to ensure the satisfaction\nof existing customers, and building a mutually beneficial relationship with our customers. The key elements are our:\n/nobreakspace\n •  customer-oriented culture through multi-level interaction with customers;\n/nobreakspace\n •  ability to deliver products of consistent quality, competitive ramp-up speed and fast yield improvement;\n/nobreakspace\n •  responsiveness to customers’ issues and requirements, such as engineering change and special wafer handling requests;\n/nobreakspace\n •  flexibility in manufacturing processes, supported by our competitive technical capability and production planning;\n/nobreakspace\n •  dedication to help reduce customer costs through collaboration and services, such as our multi-project wafer program, which c ombines\nmultiple designs on a single mask set for cost-saving; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  availability of our online service which provides necessary information in design, engineering and logistics to ensure seamle ss services to\nour customers throughout the product life cycle.\nWe also conduct an annual customer satisfaction survey to assess customer satisfaction and to ensure that their needs are adequately understood\nand addressed. Continuous improvement plans based upon customer feedback are an integral part of this business process. We use data derived from the\nsurvey as a base to identify future focus areas. We believe that satisfaction leads to better customer relationships, which would result in more business\nopportunities.\nResearch and Development\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequently leading to the introduction of new technologies to meet\ncustomer demand and the obsolescence of recently introduced technology and products. We believe that to remain technologically ahead of our\ncompetitors and maintain our market position in the foundry segment, we need to be a technology leader in the semiconductor industry. In 2022, 2023,\nand 2024, we spent NT$163,262 million, NT$182,370 million, and NT$204,182 million (US$6,227 million), respectively, on research and development,\nrepresenting 7.2%, 8.5% and 7.1% of our net revenue, respectively. We plan to continue significant investment in research and development in 2025 to\nmaintain our leadership in advanced process technologies. Our research and development efforts have enabled us to offer customers access to advanced\nprocess technologies, such as 7-, 5- and 3-nanometer technology for volume production, prior to the implementation of those advanced process\ntechnologies by competitors and many integrated device manufacturers. We expect to further advance our process technologies to 2-nanometer and\nbelow in the coming years to sustain our technology leadership. We will also invest in research and development for our mature technology offerings to\nprovide function-rich process capabilities to our customers. Our research and development activities are divided into centralized and fab-conducted\nresearch and development activities. Centralized research and development activities focus on developing new logic, SoC, derivatives,\npackage/system-in-package (“SIP”) technologies, along with cost-effective 3D wafer level system integration solutions, including InFO, CoWoS®, and\nTSMC-SoIC® technologies. Fab-conducted research and development activities focus on improving and upgrading the manufacturing process\ntechnologies.\n/nobreakspace\n19"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 26, "text": "To advance our process technologies, we rely primarily on our internal engineering capabilities, know-how and research and development efforts,\nincluding collaboration with our customers, equipment vendors and external research and development consortia.\nWe continually create inventions and in-house know-how. Since our inception, we have applied for and been issued a substantial number of\npatents in the United States and other countries, the majority of which are semiconductor related.\nCompetition\nWe compete internationally and domestically with other foundry service providers, as well as with a number of integrated device manufacturers.\nWe compete primarily on process technologies, manufacturing excellence, customer trust and service quality, such as earlier technology readiness, better\nquality, faster yield improvement and shorter cycle time. The level of competition varies with the process technologies involved. For example, in more\nmature technologies, competitors tend to be numerous and offer specialized processes. Some companies compete with us in selected geographic regions\nor niche application markets. In recent years, substantial investments have been made by others to establish new foundry capacities worldwide, or to\ntransform certain manufacturing operations of integrated device manufacturers into foundry capacities.\nEquipment\nThe quality and technology of the equipment used in the semiconductor manufacturing process are important in that they effectively define the\nlimits of our process technologies. Advances in process technologies cannot be brought about without commensurate advances in equipment technology.\nWe have periodic meetings with suppliers with respect to co-developing next-generation equipment.\nThe principal pieces of equipment used by us to manufacture semiconductors are scanners, cleaners and track equipment, inspection equipment,\netchers, furnaces, wet stations, strippers, implanters, sputterers, chemical vapor deposition (“CVD”) equipment, chemical mechanism polish (“CMP”)\nequipment, testers and probers. Other than certain equipment under leases located at testing areas, we own all of the equipment used at our fabs.\nIn implementing our capacity management and technology advancement plans, we expect to make significant purchases of equipment required for\nsemiconductor manufacturing. Some of the equipment is available from a limited number of suppliers and/or is manufactured in relatively limited\nquantities, and certain equipment has only recently been developed. We believe that well management of the relationships with our equipment suppliers\nis important for us as a major purchaser of semiconductor fabrication equipment. We work closely with manufacturers that provide equipment\ncustomized to our needs for certain advanced technologies.\nRaw Materials\nOur manufacturing processes use many raw materials, primarily silicon wafers, chemicals, gases and various types of precious metals. Although\nmost of our raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, some materials are purchased through sole-sourced suppliers. Our raw material\nprocurement policy is to select only those suppliers who have demonstrated quality control and reliability on delivery time and to maintain multiple\nsources for each raw material whenever possible so that a quality or delivery problem with any one supplier will not adversely affect our operations. The\nquality and delivery performance of each supplier is evaluated quarterly and quantity allocations are adjusted for subsequent periods based on the\nevaluation.\nThe most important raw material used in our production is silicon wafer, which is the basic raw material from which integrated circuits are made.\nIn pursuit of high quality raw wafers, the majority of our raw wafers are supplied by a limited number of suppliers located in Taiwan, Japan, Germany,\nand Singapore. We have in the past obtained, and believe we will continue to be able to obtain, a sufficient supply of wafers. In order to secure a reliable\nand flexible supply of high quality wafers, we have entered into long-term agreements and intend to continue to develop strategic relationships with\nmajor wafer suppliers to cover our anticipated wafer needs for future years. Also, we actively address supply chain issues and bring together fab\noperations, materials management, quality system and risk management teams to mitigate potential supply chain risks and enhance supply chain agility.\nThis taskforce works with our primary suppliers to review their business continuity plans, qualify their dual-plant materials, prepare safety inventories,\nimprove the quality of their products, and manage the supply chain risks of their suppliers.

We have installed in our fabs various types of pollution control equipment for the\ntreatment of gaseous and liquid chemical wastes and wastewater, equipment for GHG emission reduction and equipment for the recycling of used\nchemicals and treated water. Operations at our fabs are subject to regulations and periodic monitoring by the R.O.C. Ministry of Environment, the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the State Environmental Protection Administration of China, the Japan Ministry of the Environment, the European\nEnvironment Agency and European Chemicals Agency, and local environmental protection authorities in Taiwan, the U.S., China, Japan and Germany.\nWe have adopted pollution control and GHG emission reduction measures to ensure compliance with environmental protection and climate related\nstandards consistent with the practice of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan, the U.S., China, Japan and Europe. We conduct environmental audits at\nleast once annually to ensure that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and climate related laws and regulations.\nAn environmental, safety and health (“ESH”) team operates at the corporate level that is responsible for policy establishment and enforcement,\ncoordination with ESH teams located at each manufacturing facility and for coordination and interaction with government agencies worldwide.\nTo fulfill our commitment to environmental sustainability in our business and operations, we have continued to explore and participate in\ninitiatives to expand our use of renewable energy. In 2024, TSMC used in total 3,610 GWh in renewable energy, renewable energy certificates, and\ncarbon credits globally, of which approximately 2,160 GWh enabled our overseas sites to be 100% powered by clean energy for the seventh consecutive\nyear. As of the end of 2024, we have signed power purchase agreements to purchase 4.4 GW of renewable energy, thereby eliminating an estimated\n5.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives\nA comprehensive sustainable governance mechanism is the cornerstone for TSMC to build enduring competitiveness. We oversee our sustainable\ndevelopment efforts through the Board of Directors/Nominating, Corporate Governance, and Sustainability Committee and provide quarterly updates on\nthe progress of ESG initiatives. In addition, we have two key management platforms: the ESG Steering Committee and the ESG Committee. The ESG\nSteering Committee, led by the Company Chairman, works with the management team to establish development strategies for ESG issues relevant to the\nCompany’s operations and conducts quarterly reviews. The ESG Committee carries out resolutions from the ESG Steering Committee, pools resources\nacross departments, and instructs a dedicated ESG Department to work alongside representatives from various organizations to identify material issues,\nformulate action plans, and track their progress on a quarterly basis.\nWe currently focus our ESG efforts on the following key areas:\nDrive green manufacturing. We aim to become a leading company in environmental protection by incorporating green management into our\ndaily operations. Utilizing innovative technologies, we focus on critical areas such as climate and energy, water stewardship, circular resources, air\npollution control, and biodiversity conservation to advance sustainable development.\n/nobreakspace\n21"}

The information contained on our website is not incorporated herein by reference and does not\nconstitute part of this annual report.\nElectricity and Water\nWe have occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by our electricity supplier, or other power\nconsumers on the same power grid. Such power outages, dips or surges may lead to interruptions in our production schedule. The semiconductor\nmanufacturing process uses extensive amounts of electricity and water. Due to changes in the energy policy of the government, the growth of\nmanufacturers in the Hsinchu Science Park, Southern Taiwan Science Park and Central Taiwan Science Park, and the droughts that Taiwan experiences\nfrom time to time, there is concern regarding future availability of sufficient electricity and water for our production in Taiwan. To help address these\npotential shortages and avoid the potential impact that insufficient electricity and water supplies may have on our semiconductor production, we have\nadopted various natural resources conservation methodologies. Moreover, we have encountered and may continue to encounter increases in the prices of\nutilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, we became subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in Taiwan, which increased by 25% as compared\nto the tariff rate applicable to us in 2023. In October 2024, the electricity tariff rate further increased by 14%. The hike in electricity prices could\nincrease our manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact our financial results. Please see “Item 3. Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks\nRelating to Our Business” for a discussion of the risk related to shortages or increased prices in electricity and water.\nRisk Management\nWe employ a balanced risk-reward approach to risk management to optimize business returns. This applies to all aspects of the business, including\nour commitment to ESG issues in delivering long-term value to all stakeholders. Our risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors and\nsigned by the Chairman and CEO.

Our business model is commonly called a “dedicated\nsemiconductor foundry.” As a leader of the foundry segment, our net revenue and net income attributable to shareholders of the parent were\nNT$2,161,736 million and NT$851,740 million in 2023, and NT$2,894,308 million (US$88,268 million) and NT$1,158,380 million (US$35,327\nmillion) in 2024, respectively. Please see “ – Year-to-Year Comparisons – Net Revenue” for a discussion of the changes in net revenue from 2023 to\n2024.\nThe principal source of our revenue is wafer fabrication, which accounted for approximately 87% of our net revenue in 2024. The rest of our net\nrevenue was mainly derived from packaging and testing services, mask making, design, and royalty income. Factors that significantly impact our\nrevenue include:\n/nobreakspace\n •  worldwide demand and capacity supply for semiconductor products;\n/nobreakspace\n •  pricing;\n/nobreakspace\n •  production capacity;\n/nobreakspace\n •  technology development; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWhile the above factors are significant factors, four of which are elaborated as follows:\nPricing. We establish pricing levels for specific periods of time with our customers, some of which are subject to adjustment during the course of\nthat period to take into account market conditions and other factors. We believe that customers find value in our flexible manufacturing capabilities,\nfocus on customer service and timely delivery of high yield products, and this value is reflected in our pricing. Our pricing enables us to continue to\ninvest significantly in research and development to deliver ever-improving products to our customers, and sustain healthy financial conditions to expand\ncapacity and support customers’ growth.\nProduction Capacity. We currently own and operate our semiconductor manufacturing facilities. For the years of 2023 and 2024, our production\ncapacity was approximately 16 million and 17 million 12-inch equivalent wafers, respectively.\nTechnology Development. Our operation utilizes a variety of process technologies, ranging from mature process technologies of 0.25 micron or\nabove circuit resolutions to advanced process technologies of 3-nanometer circuit resolutions. The table below presents a breakdown of wafer revenue\nby circuit resolution during the periods indicated:\n/nobreakspace\n   Year ended December 31,\n   2022  2023  2024\nResolution   \n  Percentage of  \ntotal wafer\nrevenue(1)  \n  Percentage of  \ntotal wafer\nrevenue(1)  \n  Percentage of  \ntotal wafer\nrevenue(1)\n3-nanometer     —    6%   18%\n5-nanometer    26%   33%   34%\n7-nanometer    27%   19%   17%\n16-nanometer    13%   10%    8%\n20-nanometer     —    1%    0%\n28-nanometer    10%   10%    7%\n40/45-nanometer     7%    6%    4%\n65-nanometer     5%    6%    4%\n90-nanometer     2%    1%    1%\n0.11/0.13 micron     3%    2%    2%\n0.15/0.18 micron     6%    5%    4%\n≥0.25 micron     1%    1%    1%\nTotal   100%  100%  100%\n/nobreakspace\n(1) The figure represents wafer revenue from a certain technology as a percentage of the total wafer revenue.\n/nobreakspace\n25"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 32, "text": "In 2024, the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer revenues represented 18%, 34% and 17% of total wafer revenue, respectively. Advanced\ntechnologies (7-nanometer and below) accounted for 69% of total wafer revenue, up from 58% in 2023.\nIn 2023, the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer revenues represented 6%, 33% and 19% of total wafer revenue, respectively. Advanced\ntechnologies (7-nanometer and below) accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 53% in 2022.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate. Substantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars while we publish our financial statements in NT\ndollars. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates of the NT dollar against the U.S. dollar would have a significant impact on our reported revenue. The\nNT dollar depreciation in 2024 had a favorable effect on our revenue, with weighted average exchange rates of the NT dollar per U.S. dollar\ndepreciating from NT$31.19 in 2023 to NT$32.13 in 2024.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\nSummarized below are our accounting policies that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial results and also involve the need for\nmanagement to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain in nature. Actual results may differ from these estimates, judgments and\nassumptions. Certain accounting policies are particularly critical because of their significance to our reported financial results and the possibility that\nfuture events may differ significantly from the conditions and assumptions underlying the estimates used and judgments made by us in preparing our\nfinancial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are\nincluded in this annual report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Judgments\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied when\ncustomers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to our customers’ specified locations.\nCommencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in\nProgress (“EUI” and “CIP”). Commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended\nuse. The criteria we use to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the\nconditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\nJudgments on Lease Terms. In determining a lease term, we consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or\nnot to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option.\nMain factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the\nlessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within our control occurs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\nEstimation of Sales Returns and Allowances. Sales returns and other allowances is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in\nconsideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. We periodically\nreview the reasonableness of the estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, actual returns and allowances could be different from\nour estimates. If the actual returns are greater than our estimated amount, we could be required to record an additional liability, which would have a\nnegative impact on our recorded revenue and gross margin. For further information, please refer to note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.\nInventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value for finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials,\nsupplies and spare parts. Inventory write-downs are made on an item-by-item basis, except where it may be appropriate to group similar or related items.\nA significant amount of our manufacturing costs is fixed because our extensive manufacturing facilities (which provide us large production\ncapacity) require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once they become operational. When the capacity utilization\nincreases, the fixed manufacturing costs are spread over a larger amount of output, which would lower the inventory cost per unit.\n/nobreakspace\n26"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 33, "text": "We evaluate our ending inventory based on standard cost under normal capacity utilization, and reduce the carrying value of our inventory when\nthe actual capacity utilization is higher than normal capacity utilization. No adjustment is made to the carrying value of inventory when the actual\ncapacity utilization is at or lower than normal capacity utilization. Normal capacity utilization is established based on historic loadings compared to total\navailable capacity in our wafer manufacturing fabs.\nWe also evaluate our ending inventory and reduce the carrying value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items by an\namount that is the difference between the cost of the inventory and the net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined\nmainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon, which is generally 180 days or less.\nImpairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-Use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill. We assess the impairment of tangible assets\n(property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the asset may be impaired and the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nIndicators we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:\n/nobreakspace\n •  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n/nobreakspace\n •  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  significant unfavorable industry or economic trends.\nWhen we determine that the carrying value of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill may not be recoverable\nbased upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment for tangible assets, right-of-use assets and\nintangible assets other than goodwill based on projected future cash flow. If the tangible assets, right-of-use assets or intangible assets other than\ngoodwill are determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the recoverable amount,\nmeasured at the present value of discounted cash flows attributable to the assets, is less than their carrying value. Such cash flow analysis includes\nassumptions about expected future economic and market conditions, the applicable discount rate, and the future revenue generation from the use or\ndisposition of the assets. We also perform a periodic review to identify assets that are no longer used and are not expected to be used in future periods\nand record an impairment charge to the extent that the carrying amount of the tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than\ngoodwill exceeds the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount subsequently increases, the impairment loss previously recognized will be reversed\nto the extent of the increase in the recoverable amount, provided that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would\nhave been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, we are\nrequired to review for impairment groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. We determine the independent cash\nflows that can be related to specific asset groups. In addition, we determine the remaining useful lives of assets and the expected future revenue and\nexpenses associated with the assets. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in\nsignificant impairment charges or reversal in future periods. Our projection for future cash flow is generally lower during periods of reduced earnings.\nAs a result, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when our operating results are already otherwise depressed. For further\ninformation, including impairment losses recognized in 2023 and 2024, please refer to note 15, note 16 and note 17 to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nRealization of Deferred Income Tax Assets. When we have temporary differences in the amount of tax expenses recorded for tax purposes and\nfinancial reporting purposes, we may be able to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in future periods. We generally\nrecognize deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future to utilize such assets. The\nincome tax benefit or expense is recorded when there is a net change in our total deferred tax assets and liabilities in a period. The ultimate realization of\nthe deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences may be utilized.\nSpecifically, the realization of deferred income tax assets is impacted by our expected future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, Alternative\nMinimum Tax (“AMT”), the surtax imposed on unappropriated earnings and the amount of tax credits that can be utilized within the statutory period. In\ndetermining the amount of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, we considered past performance, the general outlook of the semiconductor\nindustry, business conditions, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.\n/nobreakspace\n27"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 34, "text": "Because the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized is based, in part, on our forecast of future profitability, it is\ninherently uncertain and subjective. Changes in market conditions and our assumptions may cause the actual future profitability to differ materially from\nour current expectation, which may require us to increase or decrease the deferred tax assets that we have recorded. For further information, including\nthe amount of deferred tax assets as of the end of 2023 and 2024, please refer to note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.\nDetermination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates. In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease\npayments, we mainly take into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic\nenvironment.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data from our consolidated statements of profit or loss and other\ncomprehensive income, expressed in each case as a percentage of net revenue:\n/nobreakspace\n   For the year ended December 31,  \n     2022      2023      2024   \nNet revenue    100.0%   100.0%   100.0% \nCost of revenue    (40.4)%   (45.6)%   (43.9)% \nGross profit    59.6%   54.4%   56.1% \nOperating expenses     \nResearch and development    (7.2)%   (8.5)%   (7.1)% \nGeneral and administrative    (2.4)%   (2.8)%   (2.9)% \nMarketing    (0.4)%   (0.5)%   (0.4)% \nTotal operating expenses    (10.0)%   (11.8)%   (10.4)% \nOther operating income and expenses, net    (0.1)%   0.0%   0.0% \nIncome from operations    49.5%   42.6%   45.7% \nNon-operating income and expenses    1.0%   2.7%   2.9% \nIncome before income tax    50.5%   45.3%   48.6% \nIncome tax expense    (6.6)%   (5.9)%   (8.6)% \nNet income    43.9%   39.4%   40.0% \nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year, net of income tax    1.8%   (0.4)%   2.5% \nTotal comprehensive income for the year    45.7%   39.0%   42.5% \nNet income attributable to shareholders of the parent    43.9%   39.4%   40.0% \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests    0.0%   0.0%   0.0% \nYear-to-Year Comparisons\nNet Revenue and Gross Margin\n/nobreakspace\n   For the year ended December 31,  \n    2022     2023    \n % Change\n  in NT$\nfrom 2022   2024   \n % Change \nin NT$\nfrom 2023  \n   NT$   NT$       NT$     US$     \n   (in millions, except for percentages and wafer shipment)  \nNet revenue    2,263,891   2,161,736   (4.5)%   2,894,308   88,268   33.9% \nCost of revenue    (915,536)   (986,625)   7.8%   (1,269,954)   (38,730)   28.7% \n                   \nGross profit    1,348,355   1,175,111   (12.8)%   1,624,354   49,538   38.2% \n    \n \n   \n \n    \n \n   \n \n \nGross margin percentage    59.6%   54.4%   —   56.1%   56.1%   — \nWafer (12-inch equivalent) shipment(1)    15,253   12,002   —   12,910   12,910   — \n/nobreakspace\n(1) In thousands.\n/nobreakspace\n28"}

Controlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules enacted in 2016 have been implemented\nsince January 1, 2023, pursuant to which, certain profits retained at a CFC located in a low-tax jurisdiction would be taxable at its parent company in\nTaiwan. On the other hand, effective from January 1, 2023, the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation was amended such that eligible companies that\ndevelop innovative technologies domestically and possess leading position in global supply chain may claim investment tax credit of 25% on qualified\nR&D expenditure and 5% on procurement of machinery/equipment for advanced processes. We are eligible for these new incentives pursuant to the\nR.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation.\nThe alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) imposed under the R.O.C. AMT Act is a supplemental income tax which applies if the amount of regular\nincome tax calculated pursuant to the R.O.C. Income Tax Act and relevant laws and regulations is below the amount of basic tax prescribed under the\nR.O.C. AMT Act. The taxable income for calculating AMT includes most income that is exempt from income tax under various legislations, such as tax\nholidays. The prevailing AMT rate for business entities is 12%.\nWe were eligible for five-year tax holidays for income generated from construction and capacity expansions of production facilities according to\nregulations under the Statute for Upgrading Industries of the R.O.C. The exemption period may begin at any time within five years, as applicable,\nfollowing the completion of a construction or expansion of production facilities. The Statute for Upgrading Industries expired at the end of 2009.\nHowever, under the Grandfather Clause, we can continue to be eligible for five-year tax holidays if the relevant investment plans were approved by\nR.O.C. tax authority before the expiration of the Statute. Pursuant to the Grandfather Clause, we commenced the exemption period for part of Fab 15\n(Phase I to IV) and part of Fab 14 (Phase III to IV) in 2018.

TSMC Arizona and TSMC are referred to collectively as the Obligor Group. Each guarantee provided under the Indenture is\nreferred to as a Guarantee and collectively, the Guarantees. TSMC Arizona is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Arizona and a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of TSMC. As of December 31, 2024, the debt securities issued by TSMC Arizona are: (i) US$1.25 billion aggregate principal\namount of the 1.750% Guaranteed Notes due 2026, (ii) US$1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2.500% Guaranteed Notes due 2031, (iii)\nUS$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 3.125% Guaranteed Notes due 2041, (iv) US$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 3.250%\nGuaranteed Notes due 2051, (v) US$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 3.875% Guaranteed Notes due 2027, (vi) US$500 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of the 4.125% Guaranteed Notes due 2029, (vii) US$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 4.250% Guaranteed Notes due 2032,\nand (viii) US$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 4.500% Guaranteed Notes due 2052.\nUnder the terms of the Indenture and the Guarantees, TSMC fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each holder the full and prompt\npayment of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, such debt securities (including any Additional Amounts, as defined in the Indenture,\npayable in respect thereof) when and as the same shall become due and payable as provided in such debt securities. TSMC (i) agrees that its obligations\nunder the Guarantees will be enforceable irrespective of any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the debt securities or the Indenture and\n(ii) waives its right to require the trustee to pursue or exhaust its legal or equitable remedies against the issuer prior to exercising its rights under the\nGuarantees. Moreover, if at any time any amount paid under a debt security or the Indenture is rescinded or must otherwise be restored, the rights of the\nholders of the debt securities under the Guarantees will be reinstated with respect to such payments as though such payment had not been made.\nThe Guarantees (i) constitute senior unsecured obligations of TSMC, (ii) at all times rank at least equally with all other present and future senior\nunsecured obligations of TSMC, except as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, (iii) are senior in right of payment to all future subordinated\nobligations of TSMC and (iv) are effectively subordinated to secured obligations of TSMC, to the extent of the assets serving as security therefor.\n/nobreakspace\n33"}

The Climate Change\nResponse Act of the R.O.C., effective February 2023, set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions in Taiwan by 2050 and established a carbon fee system to\ncollect carbon fees.

DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nMANAGEMENT\nMembers of our Board of Directors are elected by our shareholders. Our Board of Directors is currently composed of ten directors. Of our current\nten directors, seven are independent directors: Sir Peter L. Bonfield, Mr. Michael R. Splinter, Mr. Moshe N. Gavrielov, Dr. L. Rafael Reif,\nMs. Ursula M. Burns, Ms. Lynn L. Elsenhans and Mr. Chuan Lin. The chairman of the Board of Directors is elected by the directors. The chairman of\nthe Board of Directors presides at all meetings of the Board of Directors, and also has the authority to act as our representative. The term of office for\ndirectors is three years.\nPursuant to the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, effective from January 1, 2007, a public company is required to either establish an audit\ncommittee or to have supervisors. A public company’s audit committee should be composed of all of its independent directors but not less than three, of\nwhich at least one member should have accounting or related financial management expertise, and the relevant provisions under the R.O.C. Securities\nand Exchange Act, the R.O.C. Company Act and other laws applicable to the supervisors are also applicable to the audit committee. Pursuant to the\nR.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, effective from March 18, 2011, we are also required to establish a compensation committee which must be\ncomposed of qualified independent members as defined under local law. We established our audit committee (the “Audit Committee”) and compensation\ncommittee (the “Compensation Committee”) in 2002 and 2003, respectively (several years before being legally required to do so), both of which are\nnow composed entirely of independent directors. In February 2023, our Board of Directors approved the renaming of the Audit Committee as “Audit\nand Risk Committee” and the Compensation Committee as “Compensation and People Development Committee”, and the establishment of a\nNominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, each effective as of February 14, 2023.\nPursuant to the R.O.C. Company Act, a person may serve as our director in his personal capacity or as the representative of another legal entity. A\ndirector who serves as the representative of a legal entity may be removed or replaced at any time at the discretion of that legal entity, and the\nreplacement director may serve the remainder of the term of office of the replaced director. For example, the National Development Fund of the R.O.C.,\none of our largest shareholders, has served as our director since our founding. As a corporate entity, the National Development Fund is required to\nappoint a representative to act on its behalf. Mr. Chin-Ching Liu has been the representative of the National Development Fund since June 6, 2024.\nIn June 2024, our former Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, retired from TSMC. Our CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, was elected in our Shareholders’ Meeting in June\n2024 to succeed as our Chairman.\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors approved the appointment of Senior Vice President of R&D, Dr. Y .J.

These\nrules link the compensation of employees with shareholders’ interests and/or our ESG achievements. The 2021 Rules, 2022 Rules, 2023 Rules, and 2024\nRules authorized the grant of up to 2,600,000 common shares, up to 3,065,000 common shares, up to 6,249,000 common shares, and up to 4,185,000\ncommon shares, with par value of NT$10 per share, respectively. The grants are in the form of RSAs. The 2021 Rules, 2022 Rules, 2023 Rules, and\n2024 Rules became effective on August 6, 2021, July 25, 2022, December 28, 2023, and July 31, 2024, respectively.\nUnder these rules, RSAs may be granted to full-time executives and/or critical talents who meet specific performance requirements. The number\nof RSAs granted is determined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Compensation and People Development Committee\nand the Board of Directors. The number of RSAs granted under the 2023 Rules and 2024 Rules also requires approval from the Audit and Risk\nCommittee. Grants under these rules are made free of charge to the recipients and are subject to certain vesting conditions, as separately outlined in the\nrules for each respective year.\nUnder each of the 2021 Rules, 2022 Rules, 2023 Rules, and 2024 Rules, the maximum amount of RSAs that may vest each year are as follows:\n50% on the first anniversary of the grant, 25% on the second anniversary and 25% on the third anniversary.\nIssuances under these rules can be granted over a period of one year from the respective effective date of the 2021 Rules, 2022 Rules and 2023\nRules. Issuance under the 2024 Rules can be granted over a period of two years from the effective date. In February 2022, our Board of Directors\nresolved to approve the issuance of 1,387,000 units of RSAs under the 2021 Rules. In February 2023, our Board of Directors resolved to approve the\nissuance of 2,110,000 units of RSAs under the 2022 Rules. In February 2024, our Board of Directors resolved to approve the issuance of 2,960,000 units\nof RSAs under the 2023 Rules. In August 2024, our Board of Directors resolved to approve the issuance of 2,353,000 units of RSAs under the 2024\nRules.\nAs of March 1, 2025, among the total 1,387,000 units of RSAs issued under the 2021 Rules, 603,443 units have vested and 783,557 units have\nbeen reclaimed, and no RSAs issued under the 2021 Rules remain outstanding.\nGlobal Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2022, we established an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”), which provides an opportunity for eligible employees to purchase our\nADSs or common shares through voluntary automatic payroll deductions, to contribute to a real and sustainable culture of employees as shareholders.\nThe ESPP became effective on May 10, 2022 and was implemented from October 1, 2022. ADSs and common shares available for purchase by\nparticipants under the ESPP will be authorized and issued ADSs or authorized and issued common shares acquired by the administrator of the ESPP on\nbehalf of participants. We shall contribute to a participant’s contribution account so that fifteen percent (15%) of the purchase price for each ADS or\ncommon share purchased under the ESPP for a participant is funded by the employer contribution. We may, with thirty (30) days’ notice to eligible\nemployees, change such percentage for the employer contribution.\nCompensation\nAccording to our Articles of Incorporation, not more than 0.3 percent of our annual profits, after recovering any losses incurred in prior years, may\nbe distributed as compensation to our directors and at least one percent of our annual profits may be distributed as profit sharing bonuses to employees,\nincluding executive officers. Compensation to directors is always paid in cash, while bonuses to our executive officers may be granted in cash, stock, or\nstock options or the combination of all these three. Individual awards are based on each individual’s job responsibility, contribution and performance.\nSee note 29 to our consolidated financial statements. Under our Articles of Incorporation, directors who also serve as executive officers are not entitled\nto any director compensation.\n/nobreakspace\n46"}

Additional Information – Description of Common Shares – V oting Rights”.\nWe are currently not aware of any arrangement that may at a subsequent date result in a change of control of us.\nRelated Party Transactions\nVanguard International Semiconductor Corporation (“VIS”)\nIn 1994, we, the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs and other investors established VIS, then an integrated DRAM manufacturer. VIS\ncommenced commercial production in 1995 and listed its shares on the Taipei Exchange in March 1998. In 2004, VIS completely terminated its DRAM\nproduction and became a dedicated foundry company. As of February 28, 2025, we owned approximately 27.6% of the equity interest in VIS.\nPursuant to the terms of a manufacturing agreement between both parties, VIS was obligated to use its best commercial efforts to manufacture\nwafers at specified yield rates for us up to a fixed amount of reserved capacity per month, and TSMC was required to use its best commercial efforts to\nmaintain utilization of such reserved capacity. In 2024, we had total purchases of NT$759 million (US$23 million) from VIS, representing 0.1% of our\ntotal cost of revenue.\nSystems on Silicon Manufacturing Company Pte. Ltd. (“SSMC”)\nSSMC is a joint venture in Singapore that we established with Philips and EDB to produce integrated circuits by means of advanced submicron\nmanufacturing processes. These integrated circuits are made pursuant to the product design specifications provided primarily by us and Philips under an\nagreement with Philips and EDB (the “SSMC Shareholders Agreement”) in March 1999, and primarily by us and NXP, subsequent to the assignment by\nPhilips of its rights to NXP and NXP’s assumption of Philips’ obligations under the SSMC Shareholders Agreement pursuant to the Assignment and\nAssumption Agreement effective September 25, 2006. SSMC’s business is limited to manufacturing wafers for us, our subsidiaries, NXP and NXP’s\nsubsidiaries. On November 15, 2006, we and NXP exercised the option rights under the SSMC Shareholders Agreement to purchase all of the SSMC\nshares owned by EDB. As a result, we now own 38.8%, and NXP owns 61.2% of SSMC. While we, together with NXP, have the right to purchase up to\n100% of SSMC’s annual capacity, we and NXP are required to purchase, in the aggregate, at least 70% of SSMC’s full capacity. See below for a detailed\ndiscussion of the contract terms we entered into with SSMC.\nWe entered into a technology cooperation agreement with SSMC effective on March 30, 1999 in which SSMC agreed to base at least a major part\nof its production activities on processes compatible to those in use in our metal oxide semiconductor (“MOS”) integrated circuits wafer volume\nproduction fabs. In return, we agreed to provide SSMC with access to and benefit of the technical knowledge and experience relating to certain\nprocesses in use in our MOS integrated circuits wafer volume production fabs and to assist SSMC by rendering certain technical services in connection\nwith its production activities. In addition, we granted to SSMC limited licenses of related intellectual property rights owned or controlled by us for the\npurpose of MOS integrated circuit production for the sole use in manufacturing products for us. SSMC pays to us during, and up to three years after, the\nterm of this agreement a remuneration of a fixed percentage of the net selling price of all products manufactured by SSMC. In 2024, we had total\npurchases of NT$3,861 million (US$118 million) from SSMC, representing 0.3% of our total cost of revenue.\n/nobreakspace\n51"}

Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, no significant change has occurred since the\ndate of the annual consolidated financial statements.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, we have received from time to time communications from third parties\nasserting that our technologies, our manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by us or the use of those semiconductors by our\ncustomers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against us and\nsettlement payments by us. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, we could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse\neffects on our operations. We are also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions.\nAny adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm our business and distract our\nmanagement, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or prospects, and subject us to potential significant legal liability.\nIn February 2025, Longitude Licensing Ltd. and Marlin Semiconductor Limited (collectively, “Marlin”) filed complaints with the U.S.\nInternational Trade Commission (“ITC”) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC and its customers infringe five\nU.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation on March 21, 2025. The outcome cannot be determined, and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the\ncontingent liability at this time.\nOther than the matter described above, we were not a party to any material litigation as of December 31, 2024 and are not currently a party to any\nother material litigation.\nDividends and Dividend Policy\nExcept as otherwise specified in the Articles of Incorporation or under the R.O.C. laws, we will not pay dividends or make other distributions to\nshareholders when there are no earnings. Our profits may be distributed by way of cash dividend, stock dividend, or a combination of cash and stock.\nPursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, distributions of profits shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend.

{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 60, "text": "Dividends and Distributions\nAn R.O.C. company is generally not permitted to distribute dividends or to make any other distributions to shareholders in respect of any year for which\nit did not have either earnings or retained earnings. In addition, before distributing a dividend to shareholders following the end of a fiscal year, the\ncompany must recover any past losses, pay all outstanding taxes and set aside in a legal reserve, until such time as its legal reserve equals its paid-in\ncapital, 10% of its net income for that fiscal year (less any past losses and outstanding tax), and may set aside a special reserve.\nBefore the R.O.C. Company Act was amended in August 2018, the Board of Directors submitted our financial statements for the preceding fiscal\nyear and any proposal for the distribution of a dividend or the making of any other distribution to shareholders from our earnings or retained earnings\n(subject to compliance with the requirements described above) at the end of the preceding fiscal year to the shareholders for their approval at the annual\ngeneral meeting of our shareholders. All common shares outstanding and fully paid as of the relevant record date are entitled to share equally in any\ndividend or other distribution so approved. Dividends may be distributed in cash, in the form of common shares or a combination thereof, as determined\nby the shareholders at the meeting.\nThe R.O.C. Company Act, amended in August 2018, allows a company, as authorized by its articles of incorporation, to distribute dividends on a\nquarterly basis or a semi-annual basis and to have its board of directors to approve the dividends in cash. Our 2019 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting has\napproved the amendments to the Articles of Incorporation to authorize our Board of Directors to approve cash dividends after the close of each quarter.\nIn addition to permitting dividends to be paid out of earnings or retained earnings, the R.O.C. Company Act permits us to make distributions to\nour shareholders in cash or in the form of common shares from capital surplus and the legal reserve. However, dividend distribution out of our legal\nreserve can only be effected to the extent of the excessive amount of the accumulated legal reserve over 25% of our paid-in capital.\nFor information as to R.O.C. taxes on dividends and distributions, see “– Taxation – R.O.C. Taxation”.\nPreemptive Rights and Issues of Additional Common Shares\nUnder the R.O.C. Company Act, when a public company, such as us, issues new shares of common stock for cash, 10% to 15% of the issue must\nbe offered to its employees. The remaining new shares must be offered to existing shareholders in a preemptive rights offering, subject to a requirement\nunder the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act that at least 10% of these issuances must be offered to the public. This percentage can be increased by a\nresolution passed at a shareholders’ meeting, thereby limiting or waiving the preemptive rights of existing shareholders. The preemptive rights\nprovisions do not apply to limited circumstances, such as:\n/nobreakspace\n •  issuance of new shares upon conversion of convertible bonds; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  offerings of new shares through a private placement approved at a shareholders’ meeting.\nAuthorized but unissued shares of any class may be issued at such times and, subject to the above-mentioned provisions of the R.O.C. Company\nAct and the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The shares with respect to which preemptive\nrights have been waived may be freely offered, subject to compliance with applicable R.O.C. law.\nMeetings of Shareholders\nMeetings of our shareholders may be general meetings or special meetings. General meetings of shareholders are generally held in Hsinchu,\nTaiwan, within six months after the end of each fiscal year. Special meetings of shareholders may be convened by resolution of the Board of Directors\nwhenever it deems necessary, or under certain circumstances, by shareholders or the Audit Committee. For a public company such as us, notice in\nwriting of shareholders’ meetings, stating the place, time and purpose thereof, must be sent to each shareholder at least thirty days (in the case of general\nmeetings) and fifteen days (in the case of special meetings) prior to the date set for each meeting.\nVoting Rights\nA holder of common shares has one vote for each common share. Except as otherwise provided by law, a resolution may be adopted by the\nholders of a simple majority of the total issued and outstanding common shares represented at a shareholders’ meeting at which a majority of the holders\nof the total issued and outstanding common shares are present. The election of directors at a shareholders’ meeting is by cumulative voting. As\nauthorized under the R.O.C. Company Act and as required by the R.O.C. FSC, we have adopted a nomination procedure for election of our directors in\nour Articles of Incorporation. According to our Articles of Incorporation, ballots for the election of directors and independent directors are cast\nseparately.\n/nobreakspace\n54"}

Company Act also provides that in order to approve certain major corporate actions, including but not limited to, (i) any amendment to\nthe articles of incorporation (which is required for, among other actions, any increase in authorized share capital), (ii) execution, modification or\ntermination of any contracts regarding leasing of all business or joint operations or mandate of the company’s business to other persons, (iii) the\ndissolution, amalgamation or spin-off of a company or the transfer of the whole or an important part of its business or its properties or the taking over of\nthe whole of the business or properties of any other company which would have a significant impact on the acquiring company’s operations, (iv) the\nremoval of directors or supervisors or (v) the distribution of any stock dividend, a meeting of the shareholders must be convened with a quorum of\nholders of at least two-thirds of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock at which the holders of at least a majority of the common stock\nrepresented at the meeting vote in favor thereof. However, in the case of a publicly held company such as us, such a resolution may be adopted by the\nholders of at least two-thirds of the shares of common stock represented at a shareholders’ meeting at which holders of at least a majority of the issued\nand outstanding shares of common stock are present.\nA shareholder may be represented at a shareholders’ meeting by proxy.

A dissenting shareholder may request us to redeem all of the shares owned by that shareholder at a fair price to be determined\nby mutual agreement or a court order if agreement cannot be reached. A shareholder may exercise these appraisal rights by serving a written notice on us\nprior to the related shareholders’ meeting and by raising an objection at the shareholders’ meeting. In addition to appraisal rights, any shareholder has the\nright to sue for the annulment of any resolution adopted at a shareholders’ meeting where the procedures were legally defective within thirty days after\nthe date of such shareholders’ meeting. One or more shareholders who have held one percent or more of our issued and outstanding shares for six\nmonths or longer may require the audit committee to bring a derivative action against a director for that director’s liability to us as a result of that\ndirector’s unlawful actions or failure to act. In addition, one or more shareholders who have held three percent or more of our issued and outstanding\nshares for over a year may require the board of directors to convene a special shareholders’ meeting by sending a written request to the board of\ndirectors, while one or more shareholders who have held over 50% of our issued and outstanding shares for three months may convene a special\nshareholders’ meeting by themselves.\nThe R.O.C. Company Act allows shareholder(s) holding 1% or more of the total issued shares of a company to, during the period of time\nprescribed by the company, submit one proposal in writing or through any electronic means designated by us, which contains no more than three\nhundred words (Chinese characters) for discussion at the general meeting of shareholders. In addition, if a company adopts a nomination procedure for\nelection of directors or supervisors in its articles of incorporation, shareholders representing 1% or more of the total issued shares of such company may\nsubmit a candidate list in writing to the company along with relevant information and supporting documents.\nRegister of Shareholders and Record Dates\nOur share registrar, CTBC Bank Co., Ltd., maintains the register of our shareholders at its office in Taipei, Taiwan. Under the R.O.C. Company\nAct, the transfer of common shares in registered form is effected by endorsement of the transferor’s and transferee’s seals on the share certificates and\ndelivery of the related share certificates. In order to assert shareholders’ rights against us, however, the transferee must have his name and address\nregistered on the register of shareholders. Shareholders are required to file their respective specimen signatures or seals with us. The settlement of\ntrading in the common shares is carried out on the book-entry system maintained by the Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation and therefore, the\nshare transfer will follow the procedures of the Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation.\nThe R.O.C. Company Act permits us to set a record date and close the register of shareholders for a specified period in order for us to determine\nthe shareholders or pledgees that are entitled to certain rights pertaining to common shares by giving advance public notice.

Executive Yuan approved an amendment to Regulations Governing Investment in Securities by Overseas\nChinese and Foreign National, or the Regulations, which took effect on October 2, 2003. According to the Regulations, the R.O.C. FSC abolished the\nmechanism of the so-called “qualified foreign institutional investors” and “general foreign investors” as stipulated in the Regulations before the\namendment.\nUnder the Regulations, foreign investors are classified as either “onshore foreign investors” or “offshore foreign investors” according to their\nrespective geographical location. Both onshore and offshore foreign investors are allowed to invest in R.O.C. securities after they register with the\nTaiwan Stock Exchange. The Regulations further classify foreign investors into foreign institutional investors and foreign individual investors. “Foreign\ninstitutional investors” refer to those investors incorporated and registered in accordance with foreign laws outside of the R.O.C. (i.e., offshore foreign\ninstitutional investors) or their branches set up within the R.O.C. (i.e., onshore foreign institutional investors). Offshore overseas Chinese and foreign\nindividual investors may be subject to a maximum investment ceiling that will be separately determined by the R.O.C. FSC after consultation with the\nCentral Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Currently, there is no maximum investment ceiling for offshore overseas Chinese and foreign\nindividual investors. On the other hand, foreign institutional investors are not subject to any ceiling for investment in the R.O.C. securities market.\n/nobreakspace\n56"}

Issuances of additional depositary receipts under the circumstances described in the third clause above will be permitted to\nthe extent that previously issued depositary receipts have been cancelled and the underlying shares have been withdrawn from the depositary receipt\nfacility.\nUnder current R.O.C. law, a non-R.O.C. holder of ADSs who withdraws and holds the underlying shares must register with the Taiwan Stock\nExchange and appoint an eligible local agent to:\n/nobreakspace\n •  open a securities trading account with a local securities brokerage firm;\n/nobreakspace\n •  open an NT dollars bank account;\n/nobreakspace\n •  pay taxes;\n/nobreakspace\n •  remit funds; and\n/nobreakspace\n •  exercise rights on securities and perform other matters as may be designated by the holder.\nIn addition, a withdrawing non-R.O.C. holder must appoint a local custodian for handling confirmation and settlement of trades, safekeeping of\nsecurities and cash proceeds and reporting of information. Under existing R.O.C. laws and regulations, without meeting these requirements, holders of\nADSs that withdraw and hold the common shares represented by the ADSs would not be able to hold or subsequently transfer the common shares,\nwhether on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or otherwise.\n/nobreakspace\n58"}

Ministry of Finance and, upon appointment, becomes a guarantor of the withdrawing holder’s R.O.C. tax payment\nobligations. In addition, under current R.O.C. law, repatriation of profits by a non-R.O.C. withdrawing holder is subject to the submission of evidence of\nthe appointment of a tax guarantor to, and approval thereof by, the tax authority, or submission of tax clearance certificates or submission of evidencing\ndocuments issued by such agent (so long as the capital gains from securities transactions are exempt from R.O.C. income tax).\nUnder existing R.O.C. laws and regulations relating to foreign exchange control, a depositary may, without obtaining further approvals from the\nCentral Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) or any other governmental authority or agency of the R.O.C., convert NT dollars into other currencies,\nincluding U.S. dollars, in respect of the following: proceeds of the sale of shares represented by depositary receipts, proceeds of the sale of shares\nreceived as stock dividends and deposited into the depositary receipt facility and any cash dividends or cash distributions received.

Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used\nfreely by exporters, and all foreign currency needed for the importation of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated\nforeign exchange banks.\nTrade aside, R.O.C. companies and resident individuals may, without foreign exchange approval, remit to and from the R.O.C. foreign currency of\nup to US$100 million or its equivalent (or such other amount as determined by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from time to time at\nits discretion in consideration of the R.O.C.’s economic and financial conditions or the need to maintain the order of the foreign exchange market in the\nR.O.C.) and US$10 million or its equivalent (or such other amount as determined by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from time to\ntime at its discretion in consideration of the R.O.C.’s economic and financial conditions or the needs to maintain the order of the foreign exchange\nmarket in the R.O.C.), respectively, in each calendar year.

We and the depositary bank will take such actions, including amendment of the provisions of the deposit agreement relating to\nvoting of common shares, as we deem appropriate to endeavor to provide for the exercise of voting rights attached to the common shares represented by\nall ADSs at shareholders’ meetings in a manner consistent with applicable R.O.C. law.\nThe depositary bank will notify the voting representative of the instructions for the election of directors received from holders and appoint the\nvoting representative as the representative of the depositary bank and the holders to attend such meeting and vote the common shares represented by\nADSs as to which the depositary bank has received instructions from holders for the election of directors, subject to any restrictions imposed by R.O.C.\nlaw and our Articles of Incorporation.

Taxation\nThe following is a general summary of the principal R.O.C. tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of ADSs or common shares by and\nto a non-resident individual or entity. It applies only to a holder that is:\n/nobreakspace\n •  an individual who is not an R.O.C. citizen, who owns ADSs and who is not physically present in the R.O.C. for 183 days or mor e during\nany calendar year; or\n/nobreakspace\n •  a corporation or a non-corporate body that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the R.O.C. and has no fix ed place of\nbusiness or business agent in the R.O.C.\nHolders of ADSs should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular R.O.C. tax consequences of owning the ADSs which may affect them.\nDividends. Effective from 2018, dividends declared by us out of our retained earnings and distributed to the holders are subject to R.O.C.\nwithholding tax at 21% on the amount of the distribution in the case of cash dividends or on the par value of the common shares in the case of stock\ndividends unless a lower withholding rate is provided under a tax treaty between the R.O.C. and the jurisdiction where the holders are residents. Starting\n2019, no retained earnings tax paid can offset as a credit against the 21% withholding tax.\nDistribution of common shares or cash out of our capital reserves is not subject to R.O.C. withholding tax, except under limited circumstances.\nCapital Gains. Starting from January 1, 2016, capital gains realized from the sale or disposal of the common shares are exempt from R.O.C.\nincome tax under Article 4-1 of the R.O.C. Income Tax Act.\nSales of ADSs are not regarded as sales of R.O.C. securities and thus any gains derived from transfers of ADSs are not regarded as R.O.C.-sourced\nincome.

On the other hand, the R.O.C. has double taxation treaties\nwith Indonesia, Singapore, South Africa, Australia, Vietnam, New Zealand, Malaysia, North Macedonia, Israel, Gambia, the Netherlands, the United\nKingdom, Senegal, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Paraguay, Hungary, France, Eswatini, India, Slovakia, Switzerland, Germany, Thailand, Luxembourg,\nKiribati, Austria, Italy, Japan, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, Saudi Arabia and South Korea, which may limit the rate of R.O.C. withholding tax on\ndividends paid with respect to common shares in R.O.C. companies. The ADS holders may or may not be considered to hold common shares for the\npurposes of these treaties. The holders should consult their tax advisors concerning their eligibility for the benefits with respect to the ADSs.\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation\nThis section discusses the material United States federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of our common shares or ADSs.

In addition, this section\nis based in part upon the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its\nterms. In general, for United States federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing ADSs, you will be treated as the owner of the shares\nrepresented by those ADSs. Exchanges of shares for ADRs, and ADRs for shares, generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax.\nYou are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of common shares or ADSs and you are, for United States federal income tax purposes:\n/nobreakspace\n •  a citizen or resident of the United States;\n/nobreakspace\n •  a United States domestic corporation, or other entity subject to United States federal income tax as a domestic corporation;\n/nobreakspace\n •  an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source; or\n/nobreakspace\n •  a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more United Stat es persons are\nauthorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\nA “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of common shares or ADSs that is not a United States person and is not a partnership for United States\nfederal income tax purposes.\nIf a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of the common\nshares or ADSs, the United States tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of\nthe partnership. A holder of the common shares or ADSs that is a partnership and partners in such a partnership should consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the United States federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of common shares or ADSs.\nThe tax treatment of your common shares or ADSs will depend in part on whether or not we are classified as a passive foreign investment\ncompany (“PFIC”), for United States federal income tax purposes. Except as discussed below under “—PFIC Rules”, this discussion assumes that we\nare not classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes.\nYou should consult your own tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local income tax and other tax consequences of owning and\ndisposing of common shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\nU.S. Holders\nTaxation of Distributions\nIf you are a U.S. holder, the gross amount of any distribution we pay in respect of your common shares or ADSs out of our current or accumulated\nearnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes), other than certain pro-rata distributions of our common shares,\nincluding the amount of any R.O.C. tax withheld, will be treated as a dividend that is subject to United States federal income taxation. Because we do\nnot expect to calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, a U.S. holder should expect that any distribution made by us to\nsuch holder will generally be treated as a dividend. If you are a noncorporate U.S. holder, dividends that constitute qualified dividend income will be\ntaxable to you at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that you hold our common shares or ADSs for more than 60 days\nduring the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding period requirements. Dividends we pay with respect to\nthe ADSs will be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the ADSs are readily tradable on the NYSE or\nanother established securities market in the United States. Our ADSs are listed on the NYSE, and we therefore expect that dividends we pay with respect\nto the ADSs will be qualified dividend income. It is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to the common shares will be qualified dividend\nincome.\n/nobreakspace\n63"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 70, "text": "The dividend is taxable to you when you, in the case of common shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, receive the dividend actually or\nconstructively. The dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to United States corporations in respect of\ndividends received from other United States corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income will be the U.S.\ndollar value of the NT dollar payments made, determined at the spot NT dollar/U.S. dollar rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of\nwhether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period\nfrom the date of the dividend distribution to the date the payment is converted into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be\neligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the United\nStates for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\nSubject to generally applicable limitations and restrictions, it is possible that the R.O.C. taxes withheld from dividend distributions and paid over\nto the R.O.C. would be eligible for credit against your U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit\nlimitation with respect to dividends that are subject to the preferential tax rates. Dividends will generally be income from sources outside the United\nStates. Dividends will generally be “passive” income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you. The rules applicable to the\nUnited States foreign tax credit are complex, and you should consult your own tax adviser concerning the availability of the credit in your particular\ncircumstances.\nPro rata distributions of common shares by us to holders of common shares or ADSs may not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Accordingly,\nsuch distributions may not give rise to taxable foreign-source income against which the R.O.C. tax imposed on such distributions may be credited.\nTaxation of Capital Gains\nIf you are a U.S. holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your common shares or ADSs, you will recognize capital gain or loss for United\nStates federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount that you realize and your tax basis, determined in\nU.S. dollars, in your common shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a noncorporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the property is\nheld more than one year. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation\npurposes. Your ability to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations.\nPFIC Rules\nWe believe that our common shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes\nand we do not expect to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually, and thus\nmay be subject to change. It is therefore possible that we could become a PFIC in a future taxable year. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we\nwill not be considered by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to be a PFIC in current or future years.\nIn general, if you are a U.S. holder, we will be a PFIC with respect to you if for any taxable year in which you held our common shares or ADSs:\n/nobreakspace\n •  at least 75% of our gross income for the taxable year is passive income; or\n/nobreakspace\n •  at least 50% of the value, determined on the basis of a quarterly average, of our assets in such taxable year is attributable  to assets that\nproduce or are held for the production of passive income.\n“Passive income” generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents (other than certain rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a\ntrade or business), annuities and gains from assets that produce passive income and certain other specified categories of income. If a foreign corporation\nowns directly or indirectly at least 25% by value of the stock of another corporation, the foreign corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as\nowning its proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation, and as receiving directly its proportionate share of the other corporation’s income.\nIf we are treated as a PFIC, and you are a U.S. holder that does not make a mark-to-market election, as described below, you will be subject to\nspecial rules with respect to:\n/nobreakspace\n •  any gain you realize on the sale or other disposition of your common shares or ADSs; and\n/nobreakspace\n64"}

If you make this\nelection, you will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above. Instead, in general, you will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any,\nof the fair market value of your common shares or ADSs at the end of the taxable year over your tax basis in your common shares or ADSs. These\namounts of ordinary income will not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital gains. You will\nalso be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the tax basis of your common shares or ADSs over their fair market value at\nthe end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). Your tax\nbasis in the common shares or ADSs will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts. Your gain, if any, recognized upon the sale of your\ncommon shares or ADSs will be taxed as ordinary income.\nAlso, where a company that is a PFIC meets certain reporting requirements, a U.S. holder could avoid certain adverse PFIC consequences\ndescribed herein by making a “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”) election to be taxed currently on its proportionate share of the PFIC’s ordinary income\nand net capital gains. U.S. holders will not be able to treat a company as a QEF if the company does not prepare the information that U.S. holders would\nneed to make a QEF election. We do not intend to prepare or provide the information that would enable U.S. holders to make a QEF election.\nIn addition, notwithstanding any election you make with regard to the common shares or ADSs, dividends that you receive from us will not\nconstitute qualified dividend income to you if we are a PFIC (or are treated as a PFIC with respect to you) either in the taxable year of the distribution or\nthe preceding taxable year. Moreover, your common shares or ADSs will be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during your\nholding period in your common shares or ADSs, even if we are not currently a PFIC. For purposes of this rule, if you make a mark-to-market election\nwith respect to your common shares or ADSs, you will be treated as having a new holding period in your common shares or ADSs beginning on the first\nday of the first taxable year beginning after the last taxable year for which the mark-to-market election applies. Dividends that you receive that do not\nconstitute qualified dividend income are not eligible for taxation at the preferential rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Instead, you must\ninclude the gross amount of any such dividend paid by us out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal\nincome tax purposes) in your gross income, and it will be subject to tax at rates applicable to ordinary income as well as the special rules provided with\nrespect to excess distributions, if applicable, as described above.\nIf you own common shares or ADSs during any year that we are a PFIC with respect to you, you generally must file IRS Form 8621.\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to\nthose described above, including our ownership of any non-U.S. subsidiaries.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their ownership of common\nshares or ADSs.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nExcept as described in the section titled “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” below, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income or withholding tax on the payment of dividends and the proceeds from the disposition of common shares or ADSs unless: such item is\neffectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the United States and, in the case of a resident of a country\nwhich has a treaty with the United States and is eligible for the benefits of the treaty with the United States, such item is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed place of business, in the United States; or the non-U.S. holder is an individual who holds the\ncommon shares or ADSs as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition, certain other\nconditions are met, and such non-U.S. holder does not qualify for an exemption. If the first exception applies, the non-U.S. holder generally will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such item in the same manner as a U.S. holder unless otherwise provided in an applicable income tax\ntreaty; a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be subject to a branch profits tax with respect to such item\nat a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty). If the second exception applies, the non-U.S. holder generally will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the amount by which such non-U.S.\nholder’s capital gains allocable to U.S. sources exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources during the taxable year of disposition of the common\nshares or ADSs.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nU.S. holders generally are subject to information reporting requirements, on IRS Form 1099, with respect to dividends paid on common shares or\nADSs and on the proceeds from the sale, exchange or disposition of common shares or ADSs unless the holder is a corporation or otherwise establishes\na basis for exemption. In addition, U.S. holders are subject to back-up withholding on dividends paid on common shares or ADSs, and on the sale,\nexchange or other disposition of common shares or ADSs, unless each such U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number and a duly executed\nIRS Form W-9 or otherwise establishes an exemption. Non-U.S. holders generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding with\nrespect to dividends, or the proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of common shares or ADSs, provided that each such non-U.S. holder\ncertifies as to its foreign status on the applicable duly executed IRS Form W-8 or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax and the amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. holder’s or non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax\nliability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that certain required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nDocuments on Display\nThe U.S. SEC maintains a website www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding registrants, including the\nCompany, that file electronically with the U.S. SEC.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, primarily in currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks\nis hedged.\nForeign Currency Risk: Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of our capital expenditures are denominated\nin currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in the\nexchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact\non our revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars.\n/nobreakspace\n66"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 73, "text": "We use foreign currency derivatives contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments, such as\nforeign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated monetary assets and\nliabilities, net investments in foreign subsidiaries, and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of\nforeign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our total monetary assets and\nliabilities, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 would have decreased our net\nincome by NT$891 million and NT$1,906 million (US$58 million) in 2023 and 2024 respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting\npositions. For further information, please refer to note 8, note 11 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risks: We are exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to our investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in\ninterest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the\ninterest paid on our debt.\nThe objective of our investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy\ngenerally requires us to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The majority of our fixed\nincome investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) or\namortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their fair value are recognized through other\ncomprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost, changes in their fair value are not reflected in asset values unless the\nassets are sold.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on our fixed income investments, a hypothetical adverse interest rate change of 100 basis points across\nall maturities would have decreased our other comprehensive income by NT$3,842 million and NT$4,501 million (US$137 million) in 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively, after taking into account interest rate hedges. For further information, please refer to note 9, note 10, note 11 and note 33 to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe majority of our debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or\nthe carrying amount. For further information, please refer to note 18, note 19 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe have entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on our fixed income investments and\nanticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\nInflation Risk: We are subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of items such as raw materials and equipment used to\nproduce our products, wage expenses and employee benefits, electricity costs, and costs in relation to construction of fabs. Although we do not believe\nthat inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high inflation in the future may have an adverse effect\non our ability to maintain current levels of profit margin if the selling prices of our products and services do not increase with these increased costs.\nOther Market Risk: Our equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce the fair value of our\nholdings. We currently do not reduce our equity market exposure through hedging activities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we had investments in\nprivate equity securities mostly through a number of investment funds with a carrying value of NT$7,209 million and NT$7,823 million (US$239\nmillion), respectively. Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our equity investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, a hypothetical adverse\nprice change of 10% would have decreased our other comprehensive income by approximately NT$955 million and NT$1,013 million (US$31 million)\nin 2023 and 2024, respectively. The actual disposal value of these investments may be significantly different from their carrying value.

Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/nobreakspace\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche\nTaipei, Taiwan\nRepublic of China\nApril 17, 2025\n/nobreakspace\nITEM 16A.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nTSMC’s corporate governance practices are governed by applicable Taiwan law, specifically, the R.O.C. Company Act and R.O.C. Securities and\nExchange Act, and also TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation. Also, because TSMC securities are registered with the U.S. SEC and are listed on the NYSE,\nTSMC is subject to corporate governance requirements applicable to NYSE-listed foreign private issuers.\nUnder Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, NYSE-listed non-US companies may, in general, follow their home country corporate\ngovernance practices in lieu of most of the new NYSE corporate governance requirements. However, all NYSE-listed foreign private issuers must\ncomply with NYSE Sections 303A.06, 303A.11, 303A.12(b), 303A.12(c) and 303A.14.\nItem 16G as well as NYSE Section 303A.11 requires that foreign private issuers disclose any significant ways in which their corporate governance\npractices differ from US companies under NYSE listing standards. This requirement is not intended to suggest that one country’s corporate governance\npractices are better or more effective than another. A NYSE-listed foreign private issuer is required to provide to its US investors, a brief, general\nsummary of the significant differences, either: (a) on the company website in English, or (b) in its annual report distributed to its US investors. To\ncomply with NYSE Section 303A.11, TSMC has prepared the comparison in the table below.\nThe most relevant differences between TSMC corporate governance practices and NYSE standards for listed companies are as follows:\n/nobreakspace\nNYSE Standards for US Companies\nunder Listed Company Manual\nSection 303A   TSMC Corporate Practices\nNYSE Section 303A.01 requires a NYSE-listed company to have a\nmajority of independent directors on its board of directors.\n  \nTaiwan law does not require a board of directors of publicly traded\ncompanies to consist of a majority of independent directors. Taiwan law\nrequires public companies meeting certain criteria to have at least three\nindependent directors but no less than one fifth of the total number of\ndirectors on its board of directors. Starting from 2024, public companies\nthat meet certain criteria are required to have a minimum of one-third of\ntheir directors serving as independent directors. In addition, Taiwan law\nrequires public companies to disclose information pertaining to their\ndirectors, including their independence status. Please see TSMC’s\nannual report and Form 20-F for the relevant year filed with the Taiwan\nauthorities and the U.S. SEC (both of which are available online at\nwww.tsmc.com) for information on the total number of TSMC directors\nand directors who would be considered independent under NYSE\nSection 303A.02 and Taiwan law.\n/nobreakspace\n73"}

In 2024, we organized a cybersecurity workshop for suppliers, sharing\nnetwork security defense solutions and practices. Nearly 800 participants from close to 500 suppliers attended the workshop, which received high\nrecognition from the suppliers. Moreover, we have collaborated with Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (“SEMI”) to set up a\nSemiconductor Cybersecurity Committee to promote security standards (SEMI E187) as well as security assessment methodology for improving the\nresilience of semiconductor supply chain. We also joined Semiconductor Manufacturing Cybersecurity Consortium (“SMCC”), which focuses on\nimportant cybersecurity topics and seeks to find solutions that will benefit the entire industry. Also, as we employ certain third-party service providers to\nhelp us and our affiliates worldwide conduct risk assessment, security defense testing and vulnerability scanning, we require such third-party service\nproviders to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in our service agreements.\nTo our knowledge, as of the date of this annual report, there is no material risk from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous\ncybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operation or financial\ncondition.\n/nobreakspace\n78"}

In our op inion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of Decembe r 31, 2023\nand 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 202 4, in\nconformity with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nOur audits also comprehended the translation of New Taiwan dollar amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation\nhas been made in conformity with the basis stated in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Such U.S. dollar amounts are\npresented solely for the convenience of the readers outside the Republic of China.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control —\nIntegrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated\nApril 17, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an  opinion\non the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCA OB and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicab le rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the aud it to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial sta tements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating th e\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and risk committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures  that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments . The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken a s a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 2"}

The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjecti ve\njudgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Chan ges in\nthese assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.\nGiven the subjectivity in determining the date to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP, performing audit procedures to evaluate the\nreasonableness of the Company’s judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:\n/nobreakspace\n1. We read the Company’s policy and understood the criteria used to determine when to commence depreciation.\n/nobreakspace\n2.

Impairment of financial assets\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including\naccounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.

Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment  is determined as the\ndifference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.\nLeases\nFor a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non- lease\ncomponents as a single lease component.\nThe Company as lessor\nRental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe Company as lessee\nExcept for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are r ecognized as\nexpenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the comme ncement date of the\nlease.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilitie s adjusted for lease\npayments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the unde rlying assets.\nSubsequent measurement is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for cha nges in lease\nliabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated statements\nof financial position.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the  useful lives of the\nright-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease\nterms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use\nassets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which\ndepend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease\npayments are discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rates.\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recog nized over the lease\nterms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine\nthose payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease li abilities with a\ncorresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated sta tements of financial\nposition.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 22"}

Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technol ogy\nlicense fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3\nyears or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method\nare reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospecti ve\nbasis.\nImpairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that th e cash\ngenerating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-\ngenerating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the\nrecoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying\namount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata  based\non the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in pr ofit or\nloss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nTangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and\nequipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered\nan impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the e xtent of\nthe impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates t he\nrecoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation  can\nbe identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest\ngroup of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated fu ture cash\nflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of\nmoney and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying am ount of\nthe asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 23"}

A reversal of an impair ment\nloss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when\ncustomers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers’ specified\nlocations.\nRevenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for\nestimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally mad e and\nadjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, whi ch is\nclassified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nIn principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15 days from the end of the month of wh en\nthe invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect , the\nCompany measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\nEmployee Benefits\nShort-term employee benefits\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expec ted\nto be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\nRetirement benefits\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees\nhave rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing b enefit is\nrecognized based on actuarial calculations.\nDefined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit pla ns are\ndetermined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net d efined\nbenefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actua rial\ngains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in\nwhich they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will\nnot be reclassified to profit or loss.\nNet defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock represents the outstanding shares that the Company buys back from market, which is stated at cost and shown as a\ndeduction in shareholders’ equity. When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the commo n\nstock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury\nstock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock\ntransactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 24"}

The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company\nperiodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.\nValuation of Inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realiza ble\nvalue of inventory at the end of each reporting period.\nThe Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of\nreporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value.

Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, TSMC\nand VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee’s monthly salary to employees’ pension\naccounts. Furthermore, TSMC North America, TSMC Europe, TSMC Japan, TSMC JDC, TSMC 3DIC, TSMC China, TSMC\nNanjing, TSMC Arizona, JASM, ESMC, TSMC Technology and TSMC Canada also make monthly contributions at certain\npercentages of the basic salary of their employees. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$4,550.4 million,\nNT$5,365.5 million and NT$5,932.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n/nobreakspace\n b. Defined benefit plans\nTSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee’s length of\nservice and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to\n2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension\nFund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee’s name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end\nof each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nThe objective of the Company’s capital management is to maintain a capital structure that ensures liquidity and supports a soli d\ninvestment grade credit rating. The capital structure includes both debt and equity. The Company adjusts its capital structure mainly\nthrough changes in the level of debt and adjustments of dividend payout to shareholders.\nThe Company’s capital management policy remained unchanged in 2024. TSMC’s current credit ratings are AA- from Standard &\nPoor’s and Aa3 from Moody’s, same as those as of December 31, 2023.\n/nobreakspace\n33. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n/nobreakspace\n a.

Financial risk management objectives\nThe Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity ris k\nwith the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.\nThe plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and/or Board of Directors in\naccordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the implementation of such plans, the\nCompany must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management\nand segregation of duties.\n/nobreakspace\n c. Market risk\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and\nequity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\nForeign currency risk\nSubstantially all the Company’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated\nin currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuatio ns\nto its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar agains t\nNT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. The Company uses\nforeign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments,\nsuch as foreign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-\ndenominated monetary assets and liabilities, net investments in foreign operations, and certain forecasted transactions. These\nhedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and\nliabilities.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have\ndecreased its net income by NT$1,704.6 million, NT$891.0 million and NT$1,906.3 million, respectively, after taking into\naccount hedges and offsetting positions.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes i n\ninterest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair valu e\nof those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\nThe majority of the Company’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at\nFVTOCI or at amortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their\nfair value are recognized through other comprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost,\nchanges in their fair value are not\n/nobreakspace\nF - 68"}

The Company has\nentered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed incom e\ninvestments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from\nmovements in interest rates.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s fixed income investments at the end of the reporting period,\ninterest rates increase of 100 basis points (1.00%) across all maturities would have decreased the Company’s other\ncomprehensive income by NT$3,831.3 million, NT$3,842.0 million and NT$4,500.9 million for the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nThe majority of the Company’s debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would\nnot affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.\nOther price risk\nThe Company is exposed to convertible preferred stocks, equity instrument investments, and other investments price risk\narising from financial assets at FVTPL and FVTOCI.\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the investments mentioned above at the end of the reporting period, the\nnet income would have decreased by NT$1,073.4 million and NT$1,216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and\n2024, respectively, and the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$631.5 million, NT$954.9 million and\nNT$1,013.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n/nobreakspace\n d. Credit risk management\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the\nCompany. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing\nactivities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed\nseparately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company’s maximum\ncredit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\nBusiness related credit risk\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company’s outstanding accounts\nreceivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk\nexposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit\nrisk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company’s ten largest customers accounted for 91% and 93% of accounts receivable,\nrespectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.\nFinancial credit risk\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limitin g\nthe exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties\nand adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.\n/nobreakspace\nF - 69"}

The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit\nexposure to any one issuer. The Company assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk in the invested\nsecurities since initial recognition by reviewing changes in external credit ratings, financial market conditions and material\ninformation of the issuers.\nThe Company assesses the 12-month expected credit loss and lifetime expected credit loss based on the probability of default\nand loss given default provided by external credit rating agencies.

The changes were mainly due to adjusted investment portfolio\nand fluctuations in exchange rates.\n/nobreakspace\n e. Liquidity risk management\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its business operations\nover the next 12 months.

On\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from discount for lack of marketability of\n10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will decrease by NT$52.7 million and NT$56.2 million, respectively,\nif discounts for lack of marketability increase by 1%.\nThe income approach utilizes discounted cash flows to determine the present value of the expected future economic\nbenefits that will be derived from the investment.

Under a technical cooperation agreement with Industrial Technology Research Institute, the R.O.C. Government or its designee\napproved by TSMC can use up to 35% of TSMC’s capacity provided TSMC’s outstanding commitments to its customers are\nnot prejudiced. The term of this agreement is for five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for\nsuccessive periods of five years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of the end of\nreporting period, the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.\n/nobreakspace\n \nb. Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties\nformed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore. TSMC’s equity interest in SSMC\nwas 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V .\nFurther, TSMC and NXP B.V . purchased all the SSMC shares owned by EDB Investments Pte Ltd. pro rata according to the\nShareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V . currently own approximately 39%\nand 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. TSMC and NXP B.V . are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of\nSSMC’s capacity, but TSMC alone is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the\ncommitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is\nrequired to compensate SSMC for all related unavoidable costs. There was no default from the aforementioned commitment as\nof the end of reporting period.\n/nobreakspace\n \nc. In February 2025, Longitude Licensing Ltd. and Marlin Semiconductor Limited (collectively, “Marlin”) filed complaints with\nthe U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that\nTSMC and its customers infringe five U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation on March 21, 2025. The outcome\ncannot be determined, and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the contingent liability at this time.\n/nobreakspace\n d.

This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by\nreference to our registration statement on Form F-6, filed with the SEC on November 16, 2007, including any exhibits thereto. In the following\ndescription, references to “you” are to the person registered with the Depositary (as defined below).\nGeneral\nWe have appointed Citibank, N.A. (the “Depositary”) as the depositary bank for our ADSs pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, entered into among us,\nthe Depositary and the holders and owners of beneficial interests in our ADSs (the “Deposit Agreement’). The Depositary’s offices are located at 388\nGreenwich Street, 26th Floor, New York, NY 10013. The Depositary typically appoints a custodian to safekeep the securities on deposit. In this case, the\ncustodian is Citibank, N.A. Taipei Branch, located at 7F, No. 16, Nanking E. Road, Section 4, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.\nEach ADS represents ownership of five common shares on deposit with the custodian. The ADSs are normally evidenced by certificates that are\ncommonly known as American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). If you become an owner of ADSs, you will become a party to the Deposit Agreement\nand therefore will be bound to its terms and to the terms of the ADR that represents your ADSs. As a holder of ADSs, you appoint the Depositary to act\non your behalf in certain circumstances."}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 186, "text": "As an owner of ADSs, you may hold your ADSs either by means of an ADR registered in your name or through a brokerage or safekeeping account. If\nyou decide to hold your ADSs through your brokerage or safekeeping account, you must rely on the procedures of your broker or bank to assert your\nrights as an ADS owner. Please consult with your broker or bank to determine what those procedures are. This summary description assumes you have\nopted to own the ADSs directly by means of an ADR registered in your name and, as such, we will refer to you as the “holder”. When we refer to “you”,\nwe assume the reader owns ADSs or will own ADSs at the relevant time.\nVoting Rights and Procedures\nSee “Item 10. Additional Information – V oting of Deposited Securities”.\nDividends and Distributions\nAs a holder, you generally have the right to receive the distributions we make on the securities deposited with the custodian. Your receipt of these\ndistributions may be limited, however, by practical considerations, legal limitations and the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Holders will receive such\ndistributions under the terms of the Deposit Agreement in proportion to the number of ADSs held as of a specified record date.\nDistributions of Cash. Whenever we make a cash distribution for the securities on deposit with the custodian, the Depositary will arrange for the funds\nto be converted into U.S. dollars and for the distribution of the U.S. dollars to the holders subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable laws and\nregulations.\nThe conversion into U.S. dollars will take place only if practicable and only if the U.S. dollars are transferable to the United States. The amounts\ndistributed to holders will be net of the fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit Agreement.\nDistributions of Shares. Subject to applicable laws, whenever we declare a dividend in or make a free distribution of common shares for the securities\non deposit with the custodian, the Depositary may, and will upon our request, distribute to holders new ADSs representing the common shares deposited.\nOnly whole new ADSs will be distributed. Fractional entitlements will be sold and the proceeds of such sale will be distributed as in the case of a cash\ndistribution. If additional ADSs are not distributed, the ADS-to-common share ratio will be modified subject to applicable R.O.C. law, in which case\neach ADS you hold will represent rights and interests in the additional common shares so deposited.\nThe distribution of new ADSs or the modification of the ADS-to-common share ratio upon a distribution of common shares will be made net of the fees,\nexpenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit Agreement. In order to pay such taxes or governmental\ncharges, the Depositary may sell all or a portion of the new common shares so distributed.\nNo such distribution of new ADSs or modification of the ADS-to-common share ratio will be made if it would violate a law (i.e., U.S. securities laws). If\nthe Depositary does not distribute new ADSs or modify the ADS-to-common share ratio as described above, it is expected to use its best efforts to sell\nthe common shares received and would distribute the proceeds of the sales as in the case of a distribution in cash.\nDistributions of Rights. Subject to applicable laws, whenever we distribute rights to purchase additional common shares, we will assist the Depositary in\ndetermining whether it is lawful and reasonably practicable to distribute rights to purchase additional ADSs to holders.\nThe Depositary will establish procedures to distribute rights to purchase additional ADSs to holders if it is lawful and reasonably practicable to make the\nrights available to holders of ADSs, and if we provide all of the documentation contemplated in the Deposit Agreement (including opinions to address\nthe legality of the transaction). You may have to pay fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges to subscribe for the new ADSs upon the\nexercise of your rights."}

Our\nnotice to the Depositary must indicate that:\n \n •  we have elected in our sole discretion to permit the rights to be exercised; and\n \n •  you have executed such documents as we have determined in our sole discretion are reasonably required under applicable law.\nThe Depositary may sell the rights that are not exercised or not distributed if such sale is lawful and reasonably practicable. The proceeds of such sale\nwill be allocated to the account of the holders otherwise entitled to the rights. If the Depositary is unable to sell the rights, it will allow the rights to\nlapse.\nOther Distributions. Subject to applicable laws, whenever we distribute property other than cash, common shares or rights in respect of the deposited\nsecurities, the Depositary will determine whether such distribution to holders is feasible. If it is feasible to distribute such property to you, the\nDepositary will distribute the property to the holders in a manner it deems practicable. If the Depositary considers such distribution not to be feasible, it\nmay sell all or a portion of the property received. The proceeds of such a sale will be distributed to holders as in the case of a distribution in cash.\nAny distribution will be made net of fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit Agreement.\nTransmittal of Notices, Reports and Communications\nThe Depositary will make available for inspection by holders at its principal office any reports and communications received from us which are both\n(a) received by the Depositary as representative of the holder of record of the deposited securities, and (b) made generally available to the holders of\nsuch deposited securities by us. The Depositary will also promptly provide or make available to the holders copies of such reports and communications\nwhen furnished by us pursuant to the Deposit Agreement. In addition, we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and,\naccordingly, file certain reports with the SEC. Such reports and documents can be retrieved from the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov).\nIssuance of ADSs upon Deposit of Common Shares\nUnder current R.O.C. law, no deposit of common shares may be made into the depositary facility, and no ADSs may be issued against such deposits,\nwithout specific approval by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission, except in connection with (i) dividends on or free distributions of common\nshares, (ii) the exercise by holders of existing ADSs of their pre-emptive rights in connection with rights offerings or (iii) if permitted under the Deposit\nAgreement and the custodian agreement, the deposit of common shares purchased by any person directly or through the Depositary on the Taiwan Stock\nExchange or the Taipei Exchange (formerly the Gre Tai Securities Market) (as applicable) or held by such person for deposit in the depositary facility;\nprovided that the total number of ADSs outstanding after an issuance described in clause (iii) above does not exceed the number of issued ADSs\npreviously approved by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission (plus any ADSs created pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above) and subject to any\nadjustment in the number of common shares represented by each ADS. Under current R.O.C. law, issuances under clause (iii) above will be permitted\nonly to the extent that previously issued ADSs have been cancelled and the underlying shares have been withdrawn from the ADR facility. The\nDepositary will refuse to accept common shares for deposit pursuant to clause (iii) unless it receives satisfactory legal opinions as described in the\nDeposit Agreement. In addition, the Depositary may, or if so directed by us, will, refuse to accept common shares for deposit whenever we have notified\nthe Depositary that (i) there are outstanding common shares with rights, including rights to dividends, that are different from the common shares held by\nthe Depositary, (ii) we have restricted the transfer of these common shares to comply with delivery, transfer or ownership restrictions referred to in the\nDeposit Agreement or under applicable law or otherwise or (iii) we have otherwise restricted the deposit of common shares pursuant to the Deposit\nAgreement."}

For example, there may be a change in nominal or par value,\na split-up, consolidation or reclassification of such common shares, or a recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets.\nIf any such change were to occur, your ADSs would, to the extent permitted by law, represent the right to receive the property received or exchanged in\nrespect of the common shares held on deposit. The Depositary may in such circumstances deliver new ADSs to you or call for the exchange of your\nexisting ADSs for new ADSs. If the Depositary may not lawfully distribute such property to you, the Depositary may sell such property and distribute\nthe net proceeds to you in cash.\nAmendments and Termination\nWe may agree with the Depositary to modify the Deposit Agreement at any time without your consent. We undertake to give holders 30 days’ prior\nnotice of any modifications that would prejudice any of their substantial rights under the Deposit Agreement (except in very limited circumstances\nenumerated in the Deposit Agreement).\nYou will be bound by the modifications to the Deposit Agreement if you continue to hold your ADSs after the modifications to the Deposit Agreement\nbecome effective. The Deposit Agreement cannot be amended to prevent you from withdrawing the common shares represented by your ADSs (except\nto comply with applicable law).\nWe have the right to direct the Depositary to terminate the Deposit Agreement. Similarly, the Depositary may in certain circumstances on its own\ninitiative terminate the Deposit Agreement. In either case, the Depositary must give notice to the holders at least 60 days before termination.\nUpon termination, the following will occur under the Deposit Agreement:\n \n \n•  for a period of six months after termination, you will be able to request the cancellation of your ADSs and the withdrawal of  the common\nshares represented by your ADSs and the delivery of all other property held by the Depositary in respect of those common shares on the\nsame terms as prior to the termination. During this six-month period, the Depositary will continue to collect all distributions received on\nthe common shares on deposit (i.e., dividends) but will not distribute any property to you until you request the cancellation of your ADSs;\nand\n \n \n•  after the expiration of the six-month period, the Depositary may sell the securities held on deposit.

If you are a non-R.O.C. person and elect to withdraw common\nshares and hold the withdrawn common shares, you will be required to appoint a tax guarantor as well as an agent and a custodian in the R.O.C.\nIn order to withdraw the common shares represented by your ADSs, you will be required to pay to the depositary the fees for cancellation of ADSs and\nany charges and taxes payable upon the transfer of the common shares being withdrawn. You assume the risk for delivery of all funds and securities\nupon withdrawal. Once cancelled, the ADSs will not have any rights under the Deposit Agreement.\nIf you hold any ADSs registered in your name, the Depositary may ask you to provide proof of citizenship, residence, tax payer status, exchange control\napproval, payment of taxes and other governmental charges, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and certain other documents as the\nDepositary may deem appropriate before it will effect any withdrawal of the common shares represented by such ADS. The withdrawal of the common\nshares represented by your ADSs may be delayed until the Depositary receives satisfactory evidence of compliance with all applicable laws and\nregulations. If the common shares are withdrawn to or for the account of any person other than the person receiving the proceeds from the sale of ADSs,\nsuch evidence may include the disclosure of:\n \n •  your name;\n \n •  the name and nationality (and the identity number, if such person is an R.O.C. citizen) of any person in whose name the commo n shares\nyou are withdrawing will be registered;\n \n •  the number of common shares such person will receive upon such withdrawal;\n \n •  the aggregate number of common shares such person has received upon all withdrawals since the establishment of the depositary  facility;\nand\n \n •  any other information that we or the Depositary may deem necessary or desirable to comply with any R.O.C. disclosure or repor ting\nrequirements.\nThe Depositary will only accept ADSs for cancellation that represent a whole number of common shares on deposit. If you surrender a number of ADSs\nfor withdrawal representing other than a whole number of common shares the Depositary will either return the number of ADSs representing any\nremaining fractional common shares or sell the common shares represented by the ADSs you surrendered and remit the net proceeds of that sale to you\nas in the case of a distribution in cash.\nYou will have the right to withdraw the securities represented by your ADSs at any time subject to the requirements listed above and:\n \n •  temporary delays that may arise because (i) the transfer books for the shares or ADSs are closed, or (ii) common shares are i mmobilized on\naccount of a shareholders’ meeting, a payment of dividends or rights offering;"}

These\ntransactions are commonly referred to as “pre-release transactions”. The Deposit Agreement limits the aggregate size of pre-release transactions and\nimposes a number of conditions on such transactions (i.e., the need to receive collateral, the type of collateral required, the representations required from\nbrokers, etc.). The Depositary may retain the compensation received from the pre-release transactions.\nLimitations on Obligations and Liabilities\nThe Deposit Agreement is governed by New York law. However, our obligations to the holders of common shares will continue to be governed by the\nlaws of the R.O.C., which may be different from the laws in the United States. The Deposit Agreement limits our obligations and the Depositary’s\nobligations to you.

Purpose and Applicability\nThis Rules is established based on TSMC Ethics Code and the requirements of relevant laws and regulations, and provides rules and guidelines to\nall employees, officers and members of the Board of Directors of the Company, and to any other person having a duty of trust or confidence, with\nrespect to transactions in Company securities. This Rules applies to TSMC’s subsidiaries (i.e., 50%+ equity ownership) and TSMC’s affiliates in\nwhich TSMC has controlling power.\nThis Rules applies to any transactions in Company securities or futures, including common stock, American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), and any\nother publicly traded securities or future contracts the Company or third parties may issue from time-to-time, including but not limited to call(put)\nwarrants, stock futures, and stock options, as well as securities or futures of TSMC’s subsidiaries, affiliates, customers, suppliers and vendors.\n \nII. Scope\n \n A. What is Prohibited?\n \n 1. TSMC Securities\nAnyone covered by this Rules is prohibited to:\n \n (1) buy or sell any TSMC securities or engage in any derivatives or futures transactions involving TSMC securities while in\npossession of Material Non-public Information of TSMC; or\n \n (2) pass such information to others who then buy or sell TSMC securities or engage in any derivatives or futures transactions\ninvolving TSMC securities.\n \n1/4"}

Accordingly, an employee, officer, Board Member or any\nperson having a duty of trust or confidence shall not:\n \n - disclose Material Non-public Information to any TSMC employee who does not need to know the information to do their\njob;\n \n - provide Material Non-public Information to family members, business acquaintances, friends or anyone else; or\n \n \n- recommend to anyone that they trade in TSMC securities, derivatives or futures while he/she is in possession of Material\nNon-public Information, even if the employee, officer or Board Director does not disclose the specific information to that\nperson.\n \n 2. Trading on Securities, Derivatives or Futures of Subsidiaries, Affiliates, Customers, Suppliers and Vendors\nThe restriction on “insider trading” includes trading in the securities, derivatives or futures of TSMC’s subsidiaries and affiliates\n(where applicable) and securities, derivatives or futures of those that are current or prospective customers or suppliers of TSMC and\nthose with which TSMC may currently be negotiating. This Rules prohibits tipping and any such insider trading based on non-public\nmaterial information.\n \n B. “Material Non-Public Information” Defined\n“Non-public information” is information that is known within TSMC that has not been publicly released. “Material information” is\ninformation either that could be expected to affect or influence the market price of the Company’s securities or that a reasonable investor\nwould consider important in deciding to buy or sell TSMC securities. Material information can be favorable or unfavorable, positive or\nnegative.\n \n1 If a person would be in possession of Material Non-public Information at the time he/she would lose status as a TSMC Board Mem ber, officer,\nmanager or staff member, then within a 6-month period from date of last employment, Taiwan law will consider the person to be an insider of TSMC\nand, therefore, the same trading prohibitions will apply to such person for that 6-month period.\n \n2/4"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 252, "text": "Whether any particular information would be considered “Material,” depends on the specific circumstances existing at a particular point of\ntime. Nevertheless, certain types of information are particularly sensitive for which special care and consideration in evaluation and\njudgment is required, such as: quarterly and annual financial results; projections of future earnings or losses; news of planned investment,\nmerger or acquisition; new equity offering; major changes in senior officers or Board Members, etc. These examples are not exhaustive. If\na person is in doubt as to whether the non-public information he/she has knowledge of is “Material”, the person should treat the\ninformation as if it were “Material” first, and consult with either the Company’s General Counsel or CFO for guidance before trading in\nany Company securities, derivatives or futures.\nMaterial Non-public Information shall be deemed to exist whenever a specific policy, decision, action plan, etc., that could reasonably\nimpact the share price of TSMC has been finally approved by either TSMC senior management, TSMC Chief Executive Officer, or the\nBoard of Directors and such information will be released publicly in the foreseeable future.\n \n C. Internet Chat Room Guidelines\nNo employee, officer or Board Member may participate, in any manner other than passive observation, in any of the investment or stock-\nrelated Internet “chat” rooms or message boards relating to the Company.\n \n D. Non-Trading Period\nIf an employee is in possession of Material Non-public Information, he/she must not trade in TSMC securities, derivatives or futures\nbefore such information has been disclosed publicly. For purposes of this Rules, information will be considered public i.e., no longer\n“nonpublic,” at the opening of trading on the second full trading day following the Company’s public release of the information.\nTrading in TSMC securities, derivatives or futures is also prohibited whenever an internal announcement to that effect is circulated by the\nCFO and/or General Counsel for such events including, but not limited to the Quiet period of each quarterly financial release.\n \n3/4"}
{"doc_id": "tsmc_20f", "title": "tsmc_20f.pdf", "page": 253, "text": " E. Priority of Statutory or Regulatory Trading Restrictions\nThe trading prohibitions and restrictions of this Rules will be superseded by any greater prohibitions or restrictions prescribed by securities\nlaws and regulations. Any employee, officer or Board Member who is uncertain whether other prohibitions or restrictions apply should ask\nthe Company’s General Counsel or CFO.\n \nIII. Reporting of Violations\nAny employee, officer or Board Member who violates this Rules or any laws governing insider trading or tipping, or knows of any such violation\nby any other employee, officer or Board Director, must report the violation immediately to the General Counsel of the Company. Upon learning of\nany such violation, the Company’s General Counsel will determine whether any action should be taken, including but not limited to whether the\nCompany should make public any Material Non-public Information, or whether the Company should report the violation to the appropriate\ngovernment authority.\n \nIV . Consequence of Insider Trading Violation\nAny TSMC employee, officer or Board Director knowingly violating this Rules shall be subject to disciplinary actions, including termination of\nemployment. Buying or selling TSMC securities or engaging in any derivatives or futures transactions involving TSMC securities on the basis of\nMaterial Non-public Information may also be subject to civil or criminal liabilities under the securities, derivatives or futures laws of Taiwan, the\nUnited States of America (as to ADRs) and other jurisdictions. A violation of the Company’s Rules is not necessarily the same as a violation of\nlaw. The Company reserves the right to determine, in its own discretion and on the basis of information available to it, whether the Rules has been\nviolated. The Company may determine that specific conduct violates the Rules, whether or not the conduct also violates the law. It is not necessary\nfor the Company to await the filing or conclusion of a civil or criminal action against the alleged violator before taking disciplinary action.\n \nV . Inquiries\nPlease direct all inquiries regarding any of the provisions or procedures of this Rules to the Company’s General Counsel.\n \n4/4"}
