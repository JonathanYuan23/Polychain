A description of certain claims is below.\nOn April 28, 2021, Netlist, Inc. (“Netlist”) filed two patent infringement actions against Micron, Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc. (“MSP”),\nand Micron Technology Texas, LLC (“MTEC”) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The first complaint alleges that one\nU.S. patent is infringed by certain of our non-volatile dual in-line memory modules. The second complaint alleges that three U.S. patents are\ninfringed by certain of our load-reduced dual in-line memory modules (“LRDIMMs”). Each complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages,\nattorneys’ fees, and costs. On March 31, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and Micron Semiconductor\nGermany, GmbH in Dusseldorf Regional Court alleging that two German patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaint\nseeks damages, costs, and injunctive relief. In rulings issued on March 7, 2024 and November 7, 2024, the Federal Patent Court in Germany\ndeclared both patents invalid.\nOn June 10, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron, MSP, and MTEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas (“E.D. Tex.”) alleging that six U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our memory modules and HBM products. On August 1,\n2022, Netlist filed a second patent infringement complaint against the same defendants in E.D. Tex. alleging that one U.S. patent is infringed\nby certain of our LRDIMMs. On August 15, 2022, Netlist amended the second complaint to assert that two additional U.S. patents are\ninfringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaints in E.D. Tex. seek injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. On May 23, 2024,\nfollowing a four-day trial regarding the second complaint filed by Netlist in the E.D. Tex., a jury rendered a verdict that Micron’s memory\nmodules infringe two asserted patents — U.S. Patent No. 7,619,912 (“the ‘912 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 11,093,417 (“the ‘417 patent”) —\nand found that Micron should pay $425 million for infringement of the ‘912 patent and $20 million for infringement of the ‘417 patent. Micron\nexpects to appeal the verdict. On April 17, 2024, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark\nOffice (“USPTO”) issued a final written decision (“FWD”) finding unpatentable the sole asserted claim of the ‘912 patent. On September 10,\n2024, Netlist filed a notice that it will appeal the ruling that the ‘912 patent is invalid to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n(“Federal Circuit”). On July 30, 2024, the USPTO issued a FWD finding unpatentable all asserted claims of the ‘417 patent. On December 10,\n2024, Netlist filed a notice that it will appeal the ruling that the ‘417 patent is invalid to the Federal Circuit. In the case of each of the ‘912 and\n‘417 patents, if the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms the FWD, then the affirmed FWD will preclude any pending\nactions asserting infringement of such patent (including any infringement verdict that is subject to an ongoing appeal).\nOn January 23, 2023, Besang Inc. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the E.D. Tex. The\ncomplaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and SSD products. The complaint seeks an injunction,\ndamages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.\n 16"}

(“YMTC”) filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and one\nof its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (“N.D. Cal.”). The complaint alleges that eight U.S. patents\nare infringed by certain of our 3D NAND products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 22,\n2024, Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“MSS”) was served with three patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Beijing\nIntellectual Property Court and on February 27, 2024, Micron Technology, Inc. (“MTI”) was served with the same complaints. The complaints\nassert that MTI and MSS infringed three Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting others to sell\ncertain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On July 12, 2024,\nYMTC filed a second complaint against the Company and its subsidiary in N.D. Cal. The second complaint alleges that eleven U.S. patents\nare infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and DDR5 DRAM products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.\nOn September 11, 2024, MSS was served with five patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court.\nThe complaints assert that MTI and MSS infringed five Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting\nothers to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.\nOn October 16, 2024, Palisade Technologies, LLP filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Micron and MSP in the U.S. District Court forthe W.D. Tex. The complaint alleges that five U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our DRAM, NAND, 3D NAND, and SSD products. The\ncomplaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.\nThe above lawsuits pertain to substantially all of our DRAM, NAND, and other memory and storage products we manufacture, which account\nfor substantially all of our revenue.\nAntitrust Matters\nOn May 15, 2018, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) notified Micron that it was investigating potential\ncollusion and other anticompetitive conduct by DRAM suppliers in China. On May 31, 2018, SAMR made unannounced visits to our sales\noffices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation. We are cooperating with SAMR in its\ninvestigation.\nOther Matters\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify another\nparty. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional\nnature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, our payments under\nthese types of agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nContingency Assessment\nWe are unable to predict the outcome of any of the matters noted above and cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or\nrange of possible losses. A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or\nentering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material\nchanges to our products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing, as well as the resolution of any other legal matter noted\nabove, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nEquity\nCommon Stock Repurchases\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ANDRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended\nAugust 29, 2024. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending\non the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2025 and 2024 each contain 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per\nshare amounts.\nOverview\nWe are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. Witha relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, manufacturing, and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio ofhigh-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, theinnovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and compute-intensive applicationsthat unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience.\nWe manufacture our products at wholly-owned facilities and also utilize subcontractors for certain manufacturing processes. Our global\nnetwork of manufacturing centers of excellence not only allows us to benefit from scale while streamlining processes and operations, but it\nalso brings together some of the world’s brightest talent to work on the most advanced memory technology. Centers of excellence bring\nexpertise together in one location, providing an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in\npartnership with teams such as research and development (“R&D”), product development, human resources, procurement, and supply chain.\nFor our locations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing together. We make\nsignificant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally increases bit density per wafer and reduces\nper-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved\nperformance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved\nread/write reliability, and increased memory density.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive we must continuously develop and\nimplement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of inflationary pressures. Our success is largely\ndependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration\nof advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage\nsolutions, and efficient capital spending.\nProduct Technologies\nOur product portfolio of memory and storage solutions, advanced solutions, and storage platforms is based on our high-performance\nsemiconductor memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND, and NOR. We sell our products through our business units into\nvarious markets in numerous forms, including: components, modules, SSDs, managed NAND, multi-chip packages, and wafers. Many of our\nsystem-level solutions combine NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases DRAM.\nDRAM: DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide high-speed data retrieval\nwith a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is turned off (“volatile”) and are most commonly used\nin the data center, client PC, graphics, industrial, and automotive markets.\nNAND: NAND products are non-volatile, re-writeable semiconductor storage devices that provide high-capacity, low-cost storage with a\nvariety of performance characteristics. NAND is used in SSDs for the data center, client PC, consumer, and automotive markets and in\nremovable storage markets. Managed NAND is used in smartphones and other mobile devices, and in consumer, automotive, and\nembedded markets. Low-density NAND is ideal for applications like automotive, surveillance, machine-to-machine, automation, printer, and\nhome networking.\n 26"}
{"doc_id": "micron_10q", "title": "micron_10q.pdf", "page": 27, "text": "Table of Contents\nNOR: NOR products are non-volatile, re-writable semiconductor memory devices that provide fast read speeds. NOR is most commonly\nused for reliable code storage (e.g., boot, application, operating system, and execute-in-place code in an embedded system) and for\nfrequently changing small data storage and is ideal for automotive, industrial, and consumer applications.\nIndustry Conditions\nThroughout 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, we experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins for DRAM. Increasing\ndemand growth, driven in part by deployment of AI and mostly normal customer inventories, combined with industry-wide supply discipline,\nresulted in a substantially improved industry supply and demand balance. Leading edge DRAM demand remains tight, driven by HBM supply\nramp in the industry. In the PC, smartphone, and consumer markets, our bit shipments are expected to be weaker until inventories in these\nmarkets reach healthier levels expected in the spring. In line with prior plans, we shifted our supply to meet the strong demand in data center\nDRAM resulting in a portfolio mix weighted more towards high growth and less seasonal segments.\nWe also experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins for NAND throughout 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, after several\nquarters of very robust revenue, NAND shipments and prices decreased as customers worked to reduce inventories to align with demand in\ntheir end markets. As NAND technology node transitions provide increases in bit output, the pace of technology transitions will need to slow\nto align supply to industry demand. We are taking prompt and decisive action to align our NAND supply with industry demand trends,\nincluding reducing NAND wafer starts and NAND capital expenditures.\nRecent Developments\nIn December 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding\npursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Idaho and two planned fabs in New York, as well as a non-binding preliminary memorandum\nof terms for up to $275 million in direct funding for our fab in Virginia.

The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $212 million (benefiting our diluted\nearnings per share by $0.19) for the first quarter of 2025. As a result of the low levels of profitability and jurisdictional mix of income, the\nbenefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the periods presented for 2024.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar\nTwo Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”).

Following the\nenactment of the CHIPS Act, we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fab facilities in the United States,\nbased on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a\nleading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with meaningful DRAM output\nprojected in 2027. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing facility, consisting\nof up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect construction site preparation to begin in calendar\n2025, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements\nfor additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends and our objective of\nmaintaining stable bit share.\nOn December 9, 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in directfunding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Boise, Idaho and two planned fabs in Clay, New York. On December 9, 2024, we alsosigned a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for up to $275 million in direct funding for our fab in Manassas, Virginia. See “Item 1.Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” We elected not to pursue the federalloans previously disclosed as included in the non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for the Boise, Idaho and Clay, New York fabs.\nIn addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We\nhave also signed a non-binding term sheet with the State of New York that provides up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab\nfacility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job\nwages.\nAdditionally, we began enablement of cleanroom space within our existing manufacturing fab in Hiroshima, Japan, that will support\nproduction of advanced DRAM using EUV lithography. We also continue to advance our global back-end assembly and test network in order\nto support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future.

In the past\nfive years, annual percentage changes in DRAM average selling prices have ranged from plus low-teen percentage range to a minus high-\n40% range. In the past five years, annual percentage changes in NAND average selling prices have ranged from plus low-30% to a minus\nlow-50% range. In some prior periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may\nexperience such circumstances in the future. Average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs have recently had an\nadverse effect on our business and results of operations, and in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations, or financial condition.\nOur gross margins may be adversely affected by a range of factors.\nIn addition to the impact of our average selling prices, our gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing decreases in per gigabit\nmanufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs. Factors that may limit our ability\nto reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins include, but are not\nlimited to:\n• strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix;\n• increasing complexity of our product portfolio, which may impact operational costs;\n• increasing complexity of manufacturing processes;\n• difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies or additional 3D memory layers or NAND cell levels;\n• process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps;\n• manufacturing yield and defect density;\n• technological barriers;\n• changes in process technologies;\n• new products that may require relatively larger die sizes or advanced packaging technologies;\n• start-up or other costs associated with capacity expansions;\n• higher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures or market conditions; and\n• higher manufacturing costs per gigabit due to fabrication facility underutilization, lower wafer output, and insufficient volume to run\nnew technology nodes to achieve cost optimization.\nMany factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which have in the past and could in the future lead to\nunderutilization of our production assets. These factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply,\ninventory surpluses, difficulties in ramping emerging technologies, supply chain disruptions, and delays from equipment suppliers. A\nsignificant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. As a result, lower\nutilization, lower wafer output, and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs could result in higher inventory carrying\ncosts, and have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nWe have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs, which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid\ntechnological changes. Our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they are largely influenced by the\ntechnology node in which the solution was developed. We strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the\ndynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels.\nConsequently, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would\nreduce our gross margins. For example, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our\ninventories to their estimated net realizable value. In addition, due to the customized nature of certain products we manufacture, we may be\nunable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications,\nwhich may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods.\n 36"}

Our gross margins may also be impacted by shifts in product\nmix, driven by our strategy to optimize our portfolio to best respond to changing market dynamics.\nWe may not be able to predict or quickly respond to trends in the dynamics of our markets and our customers or changes in customer\ndemand, which could negatively impact our gross margin. Our inability to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, and\nIndia, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. In 2024, nearly half of our revenue was from sales to\ncustomers who have headquarters located outside the United States, while over 80% of our revenue in 2024 was from products shipped to\ncustomer locations outside the United States.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n• restrictions on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers;\n• export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the\ntransfer of funds, including currency controls in China and tariffs in the United States, which could negatively affect the amount and\ntiming of payments from certain of our customers and, as a result, our cash flows;\n• compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977,\nas amended, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations;\n• theft of intellectual property;\n• political and economic instability, including instability resulting from domestic and international conflicts;\n• government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials, including delays in shipping and obtaining products\nand materials, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products;\n• problems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials;\n• issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest;\n• longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n• compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;\n• contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels;\n• disruptions to manufacturing or R&D activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments;\n• changes in economic policies of foreign governments;\n• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n• public health issues.\nIf we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by any of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, or financial condition.\nFollowing the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information\ninfrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland\nChina and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government,\nthrough CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products\nto our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n37 | 2025 Q1 10-Q"}

These restrictions may\nnot prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. Even as\nsuch restrictions are lifted, financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a\ncontinuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or market\nshare we lose, or make such recoveries at acceptable average selling prices, while complying with such restrictions.\nPolitical, economic, or other actions may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan. A majority of our DRAM production output in 2024 was\nfrom our fabrication facilities in Taiwan, and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect on us. Any political, economic, or other\nactions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result,\ncould have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia HoldingsCorporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to\nobtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greaterresources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which wecompete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased\nmanufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. Alternatively, new entrants into memory and storage market could have a significantadverse impact on our competitive position. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorablechanges in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to\nsome of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. As a result, we face the\nthreat of increasing competition and oversupply due to significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and\nvarious state-owned or affiliated entities, such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”) and ChangXin Memory Technologies,\nInc. (“CXMT”). In addition, the CAC’s decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products\nhad an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere.\nWe and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and reduce die size, which\ncould result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor\nmemory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or\nreallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital\nexpenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or\nramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by\ncommensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect\nour business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to\nshortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. If competitors are more successful at developing or\nimplementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages.\nThe competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n 38"}

These\nbarriers include achieving acceptable yields and quality for HBM products with their multiple chip layers, potential limitations on stacking\nadditional 3D memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, developing advanced packaging\nsolutions, improving power consumption and reliability, and delivering advanced features and higher performance. We may face\ntechnological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per gigabit cost. We\nhave invested and expect to continue to invest in R&D for new and existing products and process technologies, such as EUV lithography, to\ncontinue to deliver advanced product requirements. Such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our\ncosts and production output. We may be unable to recover our investment in R&D or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die\nsize or increasing memory and storage densities. Our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may\noffer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our future success\nmay depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies.\nWe are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional\nproducts or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new semiconductor\nproduct and system-level solution development. We are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands\nof our customers, which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers.\nRecent technologies, such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for HBM and other\nadvanced products in the data center and other markets, the long-term trajectory is unknown and associated demand may fluctuate. As a\nresult, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. In addition, our ability to\nsuccessfully introduce new products often requires us to make product specification decisions multiple years in advance of when new\nproducts enter the market.\nIt is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers\nare designing and evaluating samples for their products. If we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may exclude us\nfrom further consideration as a supplier for those products. The process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced\nfunctionality, performance, and reliability, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our\ncustomers. Many factors may negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with\nrespect to the development of certain of our products. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders\nup to a year in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our\nforecasts vary substantially from actual demand.\nThere can be no assurance of the following:\n• we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and products;\n• we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products;\n• we will be able to successfully market these technologies;\n• margins and cash flows generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts;\n• we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain\ncustomers, for specific chip set or design requirements;\n• we will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers' specifications; or\n• we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis.\nUnsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, or financial condition.\n39 | 2025 Q1 10-Q"}

Semiconductor fabs\nare complex, capital-intensive projects and require specialized knowledge, expertise, experience, and skill sets to construct and operate.\nOur construction projects are highly dependent on available sources of materials, and specialized equipment, as well as labor, skilled sub-\ncontractors and other service providers. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, tariffs, and other market conditions could result in\nshortages and higher costs. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers or other resources\ncould result in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, including costs to operate these facilities.\nIn the United States and in certain other regions, fab building has been uncommon in recent years. Concurrent semiconductor expansion\nprojects across the industry introduce significant competition for the limited pool of construction talent with requisite expertise and experience\nin these regions. As such, expanding production capacity in the United States and certain other regions may introduce more challenges than\nwe would experience in geographies with more established ecosystems.\nIn addition, these expansions involve several risks including the following:\n• inability to meet capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions, including during periods of relatively low free cash flow\ngeneration, resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions;\n• unavailability of necessary funding, which may include external sources;\n• inability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through the CHIPS Act and\nother national, international, state, and local grants;\n• potential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including the CHIPS Act;\n• delays and potential restrictions related to environmental and other government regulations or permits;\n• potential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies;\n• inability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget;\n• inability to attract, retain and motivate key talent;\n• inability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner;\n• increases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale; and\n• insufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced impacts from certain of the above items and, because these risks are a characteristic of our\nbusiness, we expect to experience them in the future. Depending on the nature and extent of the impact from these risks, we may be unable\nto produce sufficient capacity in the expected time frame which could result in delays in the completion of our construction projects and\nincreased costs, including costs to operate these facilities.\nWe invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns. Investments in capital\nexpenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. Significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will\nresult in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in\ncompletion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to\nrealize expected returns on our capital expenditures.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n 40"}

Our future business plans may be impacted by obtaining these government incentives, which may take various forms,including grants, subsidies, loans, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment, capitalspending, employment, technology deployment or development milestones, construction or production milestones, or research and\ndevelopment activities to qualify for such incentives or could restrict us from undertaking certain activities. Failure to achieve such milestonescould result in up to all of certain incentives being clawed back. In some cases, these incentives have additional terms and conditionsregarding our business operations or governance that are required to be satisfied as a condition to receive incentives or disbursements.\nCompliance with these terms and conditions may add complexity to our operations and increase our costs and failure to comply could resultin termination of incentive programs or clawbacks of incentive amounts received.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs, withoutwhich our cost structure may be adversely impacted and planned capital expenditures and research and development expenditures may beaffected. For example, in December 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements, providing funds for the construction of fab facilities inIdaho and New York, with the United States Department of Commerce (the “Department”) under the Department’s CHIPS IncentivesProgram established pursuant to the CHIPS Act. The awards under the direct funding agreements are subject to various conditions and wemay not receive the funding expected on the same terms or at all. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve or maintainoutcomes or satisfy the compliance requirements to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide or continue toprovide such funding. See “Part I. Financial Information –Item 1.

In addition,\nthe incentives we receive, including the funding agreements, are in some cases subject to reduction, termination, or clawback under certain\ncircumstances, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nOur business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the availability and quality of materials,\nsupplies, electrical power, water, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers.\nOur supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to\nprovide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a\nlimited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some\ncases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a\ntimely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead\nframes, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw\nmaterials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times\nhave occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the\nfuture because of the nature of the industry.

For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a\nsingle supplier. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited\ncapacity. Our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing\nprocesses and reduce our costs. Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production and could increase our\noverall costs of a ramp. Our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur construction projects to expand production and R&D capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor, materials, equipment,\nand services. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in increasing shortages and higher\ncosts for these items.

We and our subcontractors maintain\noperations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in\nmultiple locations in several countries including the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and China. As a result of the\nnecessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s\nfacilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products.\nFrom time to time, there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages, improperly functioning\nequipment and facilities, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. We have manufacturing and other\noperations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes, such as severe and variable weather and geological\nevents resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate\nchange may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that\ncould result in supply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious\ndiseases, may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines, closures of production\nfacilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping. Events of the types noted above have occurred from time to\ntime and, because these risks are a characteristic of our business, they may occur in the future.

Even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient\nvolume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs are not offset by higher per-unit selling prices.\nManufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to\ndesign, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. Some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware\nthat may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. Additionally, we\nmay need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product\nintroductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. System complexities and extended\nwarranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs.

The failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nGovernment actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to sell\nour products to certain customers or markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations.\nInternational trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and military conflicts have led, and continue to lead, to new and increasing exportrestrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other trade measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive,\nreduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure, or increase our costs for,components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, impede our ability to perform R&D activities, orotherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. Government actions in the United States or abroad may lead to further changes in trade\npolicy, domestic sourcing initiatives, increases in foreign government incentives supporting domestic businesses or other formal and informalmeasures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and/or customers. For example,following the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information\ninfrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainlandChina and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government,through CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products\nto our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n51 | 2025 Q1 10-Q"}

Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, andraw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs,decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment andsupplies. For example, increasing geopolitical tensions have in the past and could in the future result in new export controls associated withproducts, including those that support or enable AI applications, which could, in turn, restrict future sales of certain products to China or othermarkets. Such changes may also result in reputational harm to us, the development or adoption of technologies that compete with ourproducts, long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, or negative impacts on our customers’ products which incorporateour solutions. Any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, orfinancial condition.\nThe technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government\ninvestigations, legal actions, and penalties. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with\napplicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies.\nViolations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees;\nprohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.\nTax-related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in\nthe future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions,\nchallenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations\nwith respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,\nadverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nChanges to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could\nsignificantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion\nand profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in\n2025. We do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025. On November 27, 2024, Singapore enacted\nlegislation to implement Pillar Two, which will apply to us starting in 2026. While we are still evaluating the impacts, we expect our effective\ntax rate for 2026 to be in the high-teens percentage range. We also continue to monitor for additional guidance and legislative changes\nrelated to Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we operate.\nWe and others are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, or industry standards, including with respect to\nenvironmental, health, safety, and product considerations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nThe manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, chemicals, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws\nand regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes increasing regulations on a class of chemicals known as per-\nand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction,\nmaintenance, and operations of our facilities. Any changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct\ncosts, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations\nand financial condition. Any failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our\nfinancial results. Additionally, we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who\nare also subject to a broad array of laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to\nrisks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations.\n 52"}

Such laws,\nregulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting\nfrom our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us.

To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and\nmaintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and\nproduct and process technology. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from\ngovernment incentives, to be approximately $14 billion plus or minus $500 million.\nIn the past, we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, prevailing\ninterest rates, and general capital market and other economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to\nus or at all. We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and we expect to continue to experience such volatility in\nthe future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk,\nor other factors, which may increase the cost of borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of\nfinancing to fund our operations, make debt payments, refinance our debt, pay our quarterly dividend, and make adequate capital\ninvestments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have\na material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n53 | 2025 Q1 10-Q"}

As of November 28, 2024, we had debt with a carrying value of $13.79 billion and may incur additional debt, including\nunder our $2.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility. Our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows:\n• require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow\navailable to fund our business activities;\n• adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs and reduce our ability to raise funds on favorable terms;\n• limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, R&D, and other general\ncorporate requirements;\n• restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions;\n• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n• increase our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness; and\n• result in certain of our debt instruments becoming immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if applicable cross\ndefault, cross-acceleration and/or similar provisions are triggered.\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain\nexternal financing in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors\nas well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or\nthat additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other\nliquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down\nconditions and utilize our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations\nor satisfy our debt covenants, we may need to refinance, restructure, or amend the terms of our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital\ninvestments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet\nour debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nAcross our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting\ncurrency), primarily the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and\nSingapore dollar. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in some of the foreign currencies mentioned\nabove. Exchange rates for some of these currencies against the U.S. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. If these\ncurrencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar that\nadversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition.\nWe are subject to counterparty default risks.\nWe have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits,\ninvestments, and derivative instruments. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable\nfrom them. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations. A counterparty may not\ncomply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit\nour ability to mitigate our exposure. Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual\narrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for\nbankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the\ncounterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings.

In addition, this program is a use of cash,\nwhich may reduce the availability of cash for other business purposes, including investments, acquisitions, dividends, or repayment of\nindebtedness.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a\nquarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be\ndiscontinued or reduced at any time.
